# ï»¿Traditional Candle Patterns 

Japanese rice market candle patterns, returning an integer value of **-100** for bearish patterns, **+100** for bullish patterns, and **0** for no pattern match. They use the current asset price series and detect the pattern at the current bar. All candle pattern functions are listed below in alphabetical order. They are based on the TA-Lib indicator library by Mario Fortier (**www.ta-lib.org**). 

## Disclaimer: Traditional candle patterns are implemented in Zorro for the sake of completeness, but are not really recommended for serious algorithmic trading. The patterns have been established by Japanese traders for the local rice markets in the 18th century. They probably were indeed useful back then. But no serious tests found any predictive value in any of the patterns for today's stock and forex markets. If you still want to use them, be aware that the same price curve can produce very different candle patterns dependent on time zone, bar mode, and price type. Many of the patterns won't appear in assets that are traded around the clock, such as forex pairs, because their candles have normally no difference between close and next open. For finding patterns with real predictive value, use the pattern analyzer.

## *Remarks:* 

The **TA-Lib** function prototypes are defined in **include\functions.h**. The source code of the TA-Lib indicators is included in the **Source** folder. 

For different time zones, use **BarZone** or add a **BarOffset** (if you think it matters). 

At the initial **run** of the strategy when no price history was yet loaded, all CDL functions return **0**. 

## *Example:* 

## function run() 

## { 

`  `**set(PLOTNOW);** 

`  `**MaxBars = 500;** 

`  `**PlotScale = 8;** 

## *// mark patterns with triangles on the chart* 

`  `**if(CDLDoji())** 

`    `**plot("Doji",1.002\*priceHigh(),TRIANGLE4,BLUE);** 

`  `**if(CDLHikkake() > 0)** 

`    `**plot("Hikkake+",0.998\*priceLow(),TRIANGLE,GREEN);   if(CDLHikkake() < 0)** 

## plot("Hikkake-",1.002\*priceHigh(),TRIANGLE4,RED); 

## *// go long 3 bars on a bullish Hikkake, short on a bearish Hikkake*   LifeTime = 3; 

`  `**if(CDLHikkake() > 0)** 

`    `**enterLong();**
