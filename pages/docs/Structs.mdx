# ï»¿Structs 

A **struct** is an assembled object that contains variables, pointers, or further structs. Members of a struct are individually accessed using the struct name, followed by a '.' and the member name. Example: 

## typedef struct {  

`  `**int x;**  

`  `**int y;**  

`  `**string name;** 

## } SPOT;  *// defines a struct type named "SPOT"* 

## ... 

## SPOT myspot; *// creates an uninitalized SPOT struct named "myspot"* 

## SPOT\* pspot; *// creates an uninitalized pointer to a SPOT struct* ... 

## myspot.x = 10; 

## myspot.name = "test!"; 

A struct can contain **pointers** to previously defined structs, and even pointers on itself, but no pointers to later defined structs: 

## typedef struct SPOT {  

`  `**int x;**  

`  `**int y;**  

`  `**string name;** 

`  `**struct SPOT\* next; *// pointer to a SPOT struct* } SPOT;  *// defines a struct type named "SPOT"*** 

In lite-C, struct pointers can be initialized to a static struct. Example**:** 

## SPOT\* myspot = { x = 1; y = 2; name = "my struct"; }   

## *// creates a new SPOT struct with initial values that is then referenced through the myspot pointer* 

Working with structs is explained in any C/C++ book, so we won't cover it here in detail. For creating structs or arrays of structs at run time, the standard C library functions **malloc** and **free** can be used. For initializing or copying structs, use the C library functions **memset()** and **memcpy()**: 

## function foo() 

## { 

`  `**SPOT myspot;**  

`  `**memset(myspot,0,sizeof(myspot)); *// set the struct content to zero (it's undefined after malloc)*** 

`  `**myspot.x = 1;**   

`  `**SPOT\* spot\_array = malloc(100\*sizeof(myspot)); *// creates an*** 

## *array of 100 SPOT structs* 

`  `**memcpy(&spot\_array[0],myspot,sizeof(myspot));  *// copy the myspot struct to the first member of the array*** 

`  `**...** 

`  `**free(myspot\_array); *// removes the created structs*** 

## } 
\***
`   `There is plenty information about C, C++, or Windows library functions on the Internet or in online C courses. It is highly recommended for advanced lite-C programming to work through such a course or book and learn 

about **malloc**, **memcpy** and all the other library functions that you can use. 

## sizeof(struct) 

The **sizeof()** macro that is used in the example above gives the size of a variable or a struct instance in bytes. This can be used to initialize structs:** 

## #define zero(struct) memset((void\*)&struct,0,sizeof(struct)) ... 

## SPOT speed; 

## zero(speed);  *// initializes the SPOT struct "speed" to zero* 
\***
`   `Unlike C/C++, **sizeof(some struct)** requires that at least one instance of the struct exists. Otherwise **sizeof** will return 0. 
\***
`   `Arrays are internally treated as a pointer to a memory area. So, **sizeof(some array)** and **sizeof(some pointer)** always evaluates to **4** because that is the size of a pointer.
