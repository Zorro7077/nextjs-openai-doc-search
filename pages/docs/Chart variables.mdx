# ï»¿Chart variables 

## PlotBars 

Maximum number of bars to plot in the chart, or **0** for plotting all bars (default). A positive number plots the bars from the start, a negative number from the end. Enter a small number for increasing the scale of the chart and zoom in to the start or to the end.

## PlotStart 

Start bar number of the chart. Can be used to start the chart at a certain bar, f.i. 10 bars before the opening a trade (for this set **PlotStart = Bar-10;** in the trade trigger code). If at **0** (default), the chart starts 10 bars before the end of 

the **LookBack** period. 

## PlotDate 

Alternative start of the chart, as a date in the **yyyymmdd** format.

## PlotScale 

Candle and symbol width in pixels (default **5**). Use a negative number for displaying hi-low bars instead of candlesticks. The candle type is automatically switched between black/white candles, hi/low bars, and plain lines dependent on this variable and the chart size.

## PlotText 

Zoom threshold for visibility of text labels on the chart, in percent of a candle width (default = 1 = text visible on candles > 0.01 pixel). 

## PlotLabels 

Distance in bars between x-axis labels in histograms (default = 0 = label at any bar). Use this for better readability of labels in tight histograms.

## PlotBorder 

The size of the border around the chart where the axis labels are displayed, in pixels (default: **50**).

## PlotWidth 

Maximum chart image width in pixels (default **2000**), or **0** for no chart. The candle width is accordingly reduced when the chart exceeds **PlotWidth**. Note that too-large chart images can't be displayed with most image viewers. The initial chart width in the interactive chart viewer is **600** pixels plus borders.

## PlotHeight1 

Height of the main chart with the price bars in chart images, in pixels (default **480**). 

## PlotHeight2 

Height of additional charts (**plot** with type=**NEW**), in pixels (default **160**). Also used for the parameter or contour charts in training, and for determining the proportions of additional charts in relation to the main chart in the interactive chart viewer.

## PlotPeriod 

Period in minutes for updating the chart on the **trade status page** (default: **60** = 1 hour).*** 

## *Range:* 

## 0..999999 *Type:* 

## int *Remarks:* 

See **plot**. For removing chart elements such as price candles or equity curves, set their **Color** to 0.*** 

## *Example:* 

## function run() 

## { 

`  `**PlotBars = 2000;   ...** 

## } 

## Command[0] .. Command[3] 

Contains the numbers passed with the **-i** option on the **command line**. ***Type:*** 

## int 

## Define 

The name given with the **-d** option on the **command line**.  ***Type:*** 

## string *Remarks:* 

The **Command** variables are used for passing the live trading start date and bar offset to a Zorro instance in **Retest mode**. 

## *Example:* 

## function run() 

## { 

`  `**switch(Command[0]) {** 

`    `**case 1: doThis(); break;     case 2: doThat(); break;   }** 

`  `**...** 

## }
