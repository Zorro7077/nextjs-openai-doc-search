# ﻿Converting  EasyLanguage,  MQL4,  C#,  AFL, Equilla, PineScript... to C/C++ 

The ideal languages for algorithmic trading are C or C++, due to their speed and their access to large functions libraries and Python or R packages. But before starting serious algotrading with C/C++ and **Zorro**, you have probably used a traditional **automated trading platform**. So you want to migrate your trading strategies, "Expert Advisors", algorithms, or indicators to C or C++. Although the Zorro C/C++platform can directly run **R** and **Python** functions or Windows DLLs, it won't understand scripts from other platforms without adaption. Even when the syntax is also C or C# based, their trading functions are normally too different for an automated conversion. It's still a programmer's task. You can either hire 

our **algo conversion service** or do it yourself. Below you'll find some useful hints and examples. 

Generally, Zorro can replicate any indicator and any strategy or trading algorithm from any platform. The conversion will normally result in shorter, much faster, better readable, and more robust code. Here are some examples of **algorithmic trading scripts in C/C++**. Many more examples for code conversion from Amibroker, TradeStation, MetaStock, or other platforms can be found in Petra Volkova's articles on **Financial Hacker**. 

## *Comparing backtests and charts between different platforms* 

Even perfectly converted **algo trading strategies** can produce very different backtests and charts on different platforms. Especially MT4/MT5 backtests are often not reproducible with other platforms. When platform A produces a positve and platform B a negative backtest result of the same strategy - which one should you trust? Here's what to check for determining the reason of backtest and chart differences: 

## Compare the price data. Print out several candles with the same time stamps and check. Have they the same OHLC prices? Are they from ask, bid, or trade prices? Is the timestamp from the open, the center, or the close of the bar? UTC or a local time zone? Unadjusted or split and dividend adjusted? When using tick data, does it contain the same quotes? Forex, CFD, and cryptocurrency prices from different sources are normally very different on the minute or tick level. Candles of the same source look different dependent on price type (ask/bid/last) and time zone. Some platforms (e.g. Tradingview) do not synchronize bars to full hours or days, but to some arbitrary time. It is therefore normal and usual that even charts of the same date, asset, and source, but from two different platforms, contain different candles. 

## Compare the indicators. Are they based on the same algorithm, 

and return the same value? Some platforms, such as MT4, use **simplified algorithms** for some indicators and thus get different results. Even with an identical algorithm, **cumulative indicators** such as EMA or MACD can return different results especially at the begin of the simulation when the platform has a different **unstable period** or does not use lookback or unstable periods at all. 

Check the **script structure** and **bar creation**. Does it run on any tick or on any bar? Are the bars aligned on the same time? Does it trade with the same **market hours and weekend** settings? 

## Compare the account simulation. Are lot size, leverage, margin, rollover fees, and commission considered, and are they identical? Does the platform simulate realistic order filling, or a 'naive' fill mode that enters and exits trades at the current price or at the pre-set stop or entry 

levels? Some platforms, even high priced options tools, do not consider spreads, transaction costs, or slippage in their results. 

## Compare optimization and backtest methods. Is the 

test **in-sample, out-of-sample**, or walk-forward? Are parameters optimized with genetic, brute force, or platform specific algorithms? In-sample backtests, as with MT4, produce normally meaningless results. 

## Compare the performance metrics. Win rate and profit factor are normally unsuspicious, but other figures such as drawdown, annual return, Sharpe ratio, or volatility are often calculated with very different 

methods.   

## *TradeStation™, MultiCharts™, TradeSignal™* 

## TradeStation was the first platform that supported automated trading. 

Its **EasyLanguage**™, also used by **MultiCharts** and in a variant named 'Equilla' by **TradeSignal**, has a similar design philosophy as Zorro's lite-C. Although the EasyLanguage syntax is a mix of C and Pascal, conversion to C is relatively straightforward. EasyLanguage **Vars** are equivalent to C **data series**. The first element of a series has no index, thus **MyData** in EasyLanguage is the same 

as **MyData[0]** in C. Keywords are case insensitive and local variables are preserved between function calls. Array indices start with **0** as in C, but in many EasyLanguage code examples you find them starting with **1**. So the arrays are probably allocated with 1 extra element. Trigonometric functions 

(**Sine**, **Cosine** etc) expect angles in degrees (**0..360**), while in C and in most other languages angles are in radians (**0..2\*PI**). **Log** is the logarithm base ***e*** as in C. 

At the time of this writing, EasyLanguage did still not support functions, which is a strong limitation to complex projects. But separate scripts can be called like functions. The execution of an EasyLanguage script is similar to a lite-C script, with a lookback period determined by the **MaxBarsBack** variable. Aside from the function definitions, EasyLanguage strategies and lite-C strategies look very similar.

## *"Meta"-Trader 4 and 5* 

MT4™ and MT5™ are popular platform for retail traders and provided by many brokers. The **MQL4** / **MQL5** script language of their "Expert Advisors" (EAs) is based on C or C++, which would theoretically allow easy conversion to Zorro. Unfortunately, MQL4 has some issues that make "Expert Advisors" more complex and difficult to convert than scripts of other platforms. The successor MQL5 has even more issues, and consequently has never managed to replace 

the older MQL4.   MQL4 and MQL5 trades require a lot of managing by script. Series are not natively supported, but must be emulated with loops and functions. Some indicators - for instance, ATR - produce different results in MQL4 than in other platforms because they are not based on the standard algorithms, but on special MQL4 variants. Candles are based on local server 

time, and account parameters are not normalized, so any EA must be individually adapted to the country, broker, and account. To complicate matters further, MQL4 and MQL5 do not use common trade units such as lots and pips, but calculates with "standard lots" and "points" that need to be multiplied with account-dependent conversion factors. Most code in an EA is therefore not used for the trade logic, but for patching all those issues. This results in the long and 

complex 'spaghetti code' that is typical for MT4 and MT4 EAs.   For conversion, first remove the MQL4/MQL5 specific code that is not needed in lite-C, such as trade management loops, broker dependent pip and trade size calculations, and array loops that emulate series. Then the rest can be converted by replacing the MQL4 indicators and trade commands by their lite-C equivalents. 

Replace **OnTick** either with **tick** or **run**, dependent on whether the code is bar or tick based. Bar indexes are normally shifted by 1, since they refer to the new (incomplete) bar, not to the last (complete) bar. Different indicator algorithms have to be converted or replaced.

Under **Tips & Tricks** you can find an example how to replicate MQ4-style indicator parameters with Zorro. The above mentioned issues also apply 

to **MQL5**, the "Meta"-Trader 5 script language. It has some similarities to MQL4, but offers C++ language elements and requires even more complex code for opening and managing trades. 

## *NinjaTrader™* 

## NinjaScript™ is based on C# and thus similar in syntax to Zorro's lite-C. NinjaScript also supports data series in the same way as lite-C, and its basic function list is very similar; this makes script migration rather easy. One major difference is that all NinjaTrader indicator functions return data series, while Zorro indicators return single values. Use the series function 

(f.i. **series(indicator(..))**) for making Zorro indicators also return series.

## } 

## *Amibroker™* 

Amibroker's **AFL™** language is a C dialect, with similar syntax as lite-C. But the script structure is different. Amibroker uses "**Buy**" and "**Sell**" variables for entering trades, instead of a function call. And Amibroker calls functions for setting system parameters, instead of using variables. So it's just the opposite of what you would expect. This unusual concept has its reason in a sort of vectorized approach to a trading system, where the code mainly initializes parameters and signal conditions. Variables need not be declared, and they are usually series, as in EasyLanguage. Functions are often very similar to lite-C - for instance, **Plot()** or **Optimize()**. Others can be easily converted, f.i. Amibroker's "**Explore**" feature is equivalent to Zorro's **print(TO\_CSV)**.

`   `**ApplyStop(stopTypeLoss,stopModePoint,5,0,True,0,0,-1);** 

## ApplyStop(stopTypeProfit,stopModePoint,10,0,True,0,0,-1); 

## SMAFast = MA(C,10); SMASlow = MA(C,20); 

## *// Buy if 10 SMA crosses over 20 SMA*     Buy = Cross(SMAFast,SMASlow); 

## *// Sell if 10 SMA crosses under 20 SMA*        Sell = Cross(SMASlow,SMAFast); 

## *TradingView™* 

## TradingView is a charting tool with a proprietary language 

named **PineScript™** for defining indicators. Variables are declared by assigning a value to them, and language blocks are defined by indentation, as in Python. Functions are defined with '**=>**'. Data series are in reverse order compared to other platforms: the **[0]** element is the oldest. Aside from that, conversion to C is normally pretty straightforward. Example for a Simple Moving Average: 

## *// PineScript version* 

## *// SMA definition* 

## study("My sma") 

## my\_sma(Prices, Length) => 

`  `**Sum = Prices** 

`  `**for i = 1 to Length-1** 

`    `**Sum := Sum + Prices[i]** 

`  `**Sum / Length** 

## *// C version* 

## *// SMA definition* 

## var my\_sma(vars Prices,int Length) {   var Sum = Prices[0]; 

`  `**for(i = 1; i < Length; i++)**  

`     `**Sum += Prices[i];**  

`  `**return Sum/Length;** 

## } 

## *Neuroshell Trader™* 

## Neuroshell Trader is a platform specialized in employing a linear neural network for automated trading. Neuroshell indicators are functions added through DLLs. They take an input array, an output array, the array size, and additional parameters. Many other trade platforms use similar DLL based indicators. Such indicators are often based on normal C, thus conversion to Zorro is very easy - especially when you don't have to convert it at all and can call the DLL 

## function directly.    When using an indicator made for a different platform, the array order convention must be take care of. Neuroshell stores time series in ascending order (contrary to most other platforms that store them in reverse order) and passes the end of the array, not its begin, to the indicator function. Neuroshell indicators normally return an output series instead of a single value. Below both methods of indicator conversion are shown.

## } *MatLab™* 

MatLab is a commercial computing environment and interactive programming language by **MathWorks, Inc**. It has some similarity to **R**, but is not specialized on data analysis and machine learning. It allows symbolic and numerical computing in all fields of mathematics. With interpreted code and accordingly slow execution, it is not suited for backtesting trading strategies (unless they are converted to a vectorized structure, which is however an awkward process). Converting MatLab code to C is also a lot of work due to the very different language syntax. Fortunately there is a better solution: MatLab has an integrated compiler that compiles a MatLab trading algorithm to a C/C++ DLL. The DLL 

function can then be directly **called from a lite-C script**.
