# ï»¿Options, Futures, FOPs 

The following functions can be used for selecting, analyzing, and trading options, futures, and options on futures (FOPs). Since they have additional parameters, namely type, strike, and expiration, options trading is a bit more complex than trading the underlying. For a brief introduction to options trading, read the **Black Book** chapter 8 or visit **Financial Hacker**.

## contractUpdate (string Name, int Handle, int Mode): int 

Loads a new contract chain of type **Mode** (see below) for the current underlying and the current day. The contract chain contains all options, futures, or FOP contracts available at a certain date. It is required for all the subsequent contract functions and for entering or exiting contract positions. 

`  `Contract chains are only loaded when the **LookBack** period is over and real trading begins. They are loaded individually per asset and can be directly accessed with the **Contracts** pointer. Chains are automatically sorted at loading: first by expiration date, then by strike. This allows fast finding a certain option or combo. **NumContracts** is set to the number of contracts in the chain, which is also returned. If no contract chain for the current or given time is found, **0** is returned. 

`  `In [***Test***] or [***Train***] mode the chain is either read out of a contract chain file given by **Name.t8** at or before the current time, or from a previously 

loaded **dataset** of contracts when its **Handle** is nonzero. **Name** can contain month or day numbers for monthly or daily historical contract files. If **Name** is **0**, the current asset name is used. If the global **Now** variable is nonzero in [***Test***] or [***Train***] mode, it is used for filtering contracts instead of the current 

time. **ContractRow** is set to the row of the first found contract in the dataset, which allows to load extra data, such as greeks, from a second parallel dataset. 

`  `In [***Trade***] mode the chain for the symbol **Name** is either downloaded from the broker API, or - when **Handle** is nonzero - filled from a previoulsy 

loaded **dataset** with no date/time filtering. If **Name** is **0**, the current asset name is used. For contracts that are no US stocks or traded on multiple 

exchanges, **Name** should be a **symbol** with exchange, currency, and for futures the expiration date (e.g. **"N225-FUT-20220609-225-OSE.JPN-JPY"**). For limiting the chain to a particular trading class, use the **SET\_CLASS** command.

## contractRecord (string Name, var MinStrike, var MaxStrike, int MinDays, int MaxDays) 

Appends the current contract chain to the begin of the **.t8** contract history file in [***Trade***] mode. This allows recording live contract chains for **re-training** or other purposes. The prices of all recorded contracts are loaded from the broker API. Because loading contract prices can take a long time (up to 10 seconds per option contract with the IB API), the strike range and life time can be limited with the **MinStrike**, **MaxStrike**, **MinDays**, **MaxDays** parameters. Only contracts that fall into the limits and have a nonzero price are recorded. If the limits are 0, prices for the whole chain are loaded. 

Example: **contractRecord(0,priceClose()-50,priceClose()+50,1,70);** appends all contracts within a +/-50 strike range and up to 70 days expiration at the begin of the **.t8** file of the current asset.

## contract (int Type, int Expiry, var Strike): CONTRACT\* 

Selects the option or future contract from the current option chain that matches exactly the given **Type** (including **FUTURE** or **EUROPEAN**), **Expiry** date, 

and **Strike** value. Returns a **CONTRACT** pointer to the found contract, or **0** when no such contract was found. If a contract is 

selected, **enterLong** and **enterShort** will buy or write (sell short) the contract instead of the underlying asset. The function sets 

up **ContractStrike**, **ContractExpiry** and other contract variables, and 

sets **ContractRow** to the row of the selected contract in the historical dataset or in the options chain. Calling **asset()**, **contractUpdate()**, 

or **contract(0,0,0)** deselects the contract and allows again trading with the underlying.

## contract (int Type, int Days, var Strike): CONTRACT\* 

As above, but selects the option or future contract that has an expiration of at least the given minimum life time in **Days** and strike closest to the 

given **Strike** value. Returns the **CONTRACT** pointer, or **0** when no contract with matching **Type**, at least **Days** life time, and a strike closer than 10% 

to **Strike** was found. 

## contract (int N): CONTRACT\* 

As above, but selects the **N**th contract from the current contract chain, where **N** = **1..NumContracts**. If **N = 0**, the currently selected contract is deselected in order to allow trading with the underlying.

## contract (CONTRACT\*): CONTRACT\* 

As above, but selects directly the given option or future contract, and does not alter **ContractRow**.

## contract (TRADE\*): CONTRACT\* 

As above, but selects the trade and its contract from the current contract chain. Returns **0** if no contract for this trade was found, which can happen at the expiration day or when the chain was not updated. Otherwise **trade** 

## variables and contract variables are available for the trade and contract. 

## contractNext (int Type, int Expiry, var Strike): CONTRACT\* 

As above, but selects and returns the option or future contract with 

the **Type** and **Expiry**, but the next-higher strike than the given **Strike** value. 

If **Strike** is negative, selects and returns the contract with the next-lower strike value. 

## contractFind (int Type, int Days, var Find, int N): CONTRACT\* 

## contractFind (int Type, int Days, var Find, int N, var MinStrike, var MaxStrike): CONTRACT\* 

## contractFind (int Type, int Expiry, var Find, int N): CONTRACT\* 

## contractFind (int Type, int Expiry, var Find, int N, var MinStrike, var MaxStrike): CONTRACT\* 

As above, but selects the option or future contract with the given **Type**, closest to the given minimum life time in **Days**, and a parameter closest to the 

given **Find** value. The parameter can be selected with **N**: 1 = ask, 2 = bid, 3 = fVal, 4 = fVol, 5 = fUnl, 6 = strike, 7 = strike distance from the underlying. The strike range can be optionally limited to **MinStrike** and **MaxStrike** for speeding up the function. Returns a **CONTRACT** pointer, or **0** when no contract was found. If a selected parameter is not yet available, such as ask, bid, or underlying price in live trading, it is automatically retrieved from the broker API. Depending on the number of contracts that match the expiration and strike range, this function can then take a long time (up to 10 seconds per contract) on the first call in live trading after loading a new contract chain. Subsequent calls are faster.

## contractDays (CONTRACT\*): var contractDays (TRADE\*): var 

Returns the fractional number of calendar days until contract or trade expiration (see **ExpiryTime**). Returns a negative number when the expiration time is in the past. Note that the exact time to expiration depends on the time zone and market close time of the exchange where the contract is traded, so adapt **ExpiryTime** to your exchange when the exact life time in hours and minutes is needed. Note that many exchanges have restrictions to trading contracts at their expiration day.

## contractPrice (CONTRACT\*): var contractPrice (TRADE\*): var 

Updates the current ask, bid, underlying price, fill amount, and profit of the given contract or trade, either from the broker API, or from historical data by the 

last **contractUpdate** call. Returns the bid/ask mid price per underlying 

unit. Updating contract prices can be slow, depending on broker, Some broker plugins, such as **IB**, support a 'fast mode' 

by **brokerCommand(SET\_PRICETYPE,8);** this can remarkably speed up the price update. For retrieving the underlying price in live trading, 

the **GET\_UNDERLYING** command is used; for updating the fill amount, 

the **BrokerTrade** function is used and must be supported by the API. If the contract is not traded or the market data not subscribed, the function returns 0. Contract prices of open positions are automatically updated at any bar. If the underlying price is not available, it is updated from the current asset price. The underlying price is automatically copied to all contracts of the current chain with the same expiration date.  

## contractUnderlying (): var 

Returns the current unadjusted price of the underlying, in [***Trade***] mode from the broker and otherwise from the **fUnl** element of the first contract of the 

chain. **contractUpdate** must be called before. Note that FOPs have no common underlying price, but **fUnl** depends on the expiration and can be different for any contract. Source code in **contract.c**.

## contractPosition (TRADE\*): int 

Returns the current number of open lots or open contracts of the given trade (negative values for a short position). Can be used for determining if a certain contract was expired or exercised by the broker. In live trading 

the **GET\_POSITION** command must be supported by the broker API, and no other trades with the same contract type, strike, and expiry must be opened.

## contractCheck (TRADE\*, int Mode): int 

Checks the option position on the broker account in live [***Trade***] mode. If it is still open, returns the total number of open contracts (negative for a short position). Otherwise it checks for an open position of the underlying, and returns the position size. If **Mode** is at **1** and no open contract was found, the trade is automatically closed with a "**Lapsed**" message. If **Mode** is at **3** and an underlying position was found, it is sold at market. **Mode = 3** thus replicates the backtest behavior of expired options. The function can be called regularly in 

a **for(open\_trades)** loop for keeping the positions between broker and strategy in sync. The **GET\_POSITION** command must be supported by the broker API, and no other trades with the same contract type, strike, expiry, and underlying must be opened.

## contractRoll (TRADE\*, int Days, var Strike, function TMF): TRADE\* 

Rolls a closed option or future contract by opening a duplicate with the same type, volume, stop loss and profit distances, the given number of **Days** until expiration, the given **Strike** (**0** for using the previous strike) and an optional **trade management function**. Returns a pointer to the new trade, or 0 if the contract could not be rolled. Source code in **contract.c**.

## contractSellUnderlying (): int 

Checks in [***Trade***] mode if any underlying position of the current asset is open, and if so, sells it at market. Returns the number of lots, or 0 when no underlying position was found. Source code in **contract.c**.

## contractExercise (TRADE\*) 

Exercises an option contract. In the backtest, the option is closed at its intrinsic price (see remarks). In live trading, an order to exercise the option is sent to the broker. It is normally not immediately executed, but pending. 

Use **contractCheck()** for closing the trade and selling the underlying as soon as the order was executed. Don't call this function for European options before expiration, or for options that are not in the money. 

## contractVal (CONTRACT\*, var Price, var HistVol, var Dividend, var RiskFree, *var\* Delta, var\* Gamma, var\* Vega, var\* Theta, var\* Rho*): var 

Returns the theoretical value and optionally the greeks of the given option contract at the given unadjusted **Price** of the underlying. **Type**, **fStrike**, 

and **Expiry** of the contract must be set; the other parameters don't 

matter. **Expiry** can be either an expiration date in the YYYYMMDD format, or alternatively the number of calendar days until expiration. **HistVol** is the underlying annual volatility of the log returns, f.i. 

by **Volatility** or **VolatilityOV** (usually over 20 days). **Dividend** is the continuous annual dividend yield per year of the underlying, as a fraction in 

the **0..1** range. **RiskFree** is the annual risk-free yield as a fraction in 

the **0..1** range, f.i. by **yield()/100**. 

`  `**Delta** is the impact of an underlying price change on the option value, in 

the **0..1** range for calls and **0..-1** for puts. **Gamma** is the impact on **Delta**. **Vega** is the impact of a change of the underlying volatility, **Theta** is the impact of a change of the expiration time, and **Rho** is the impact of a change of the risk-free yield. 

`  `The function uses **R** and the **RQuantLib** package; both must be installed (see remarks below). Source code in **contract.c**.

## contractVol (CONTRACT\*, var Price, var HistVol, var Value, var Dividend, var RiskFree): var 

Returns the implied volatility (IV) of the given option contract with the 

given **Value**. For the parameters, see **contractVal**. The function uses **R** and the **RQuantLib** package; both must be installed on the trading PC (see remarks below). Source code in **contract.c**. The implied volatility is an estimate of the future volatility of the underlying, based on the current option parameters. If the contract has no value or if the strike price is too far or on the wrong side of the asset price, the function returns **0**. 

## contractDelta (int Type, int Days, var Price, var HistVol, var RiskFree, var Strike): var 

Returns the theoretical delta of a contract of given **Type** with the given **Days** until expiration, unadjusted underlying **Price**, volatility **HistVol**, **RiskFree** yield rate, and **Strike**. Uses the formula ***Delta = cdf((ln(Price/Strike) + (r + (sigma^2)/2) \* T) /(sigma \* sqrt(T)))***. Source code in **contract.c**. Delta is the first derivative of the option value with respect to the underlying price, and can be used as a proxy of the probability to expire in the money. Note that some platforms and brokers use individual methods for calculating **HistVol** and thus produce different Delta values for the same contracts.

## contractStrike (int Type, int Days, var Price, var HistVol, var RiskFree, var Delta): var 

Returns the theoretical strike value of a contract of given **Type** with the 

given **Days** until expiration, unadjusted underlying **Price**, 

volatility **HistVol**, **RiskFree** yield rate, and **Delta**. Uses the formula ***Strike = Price \* exp(-qnorm(Delta) \* sigma \* sqrt(T) + (r + (sigma^2)/2) \* T)***. If a positive **Delta** is entered for a put, it is converted to the equivalent negative delta, so the same **Delta** value can be used for selecting put and call contracts. Source code in **contract.c**.

## contractIntrinsic (CONTRACT\*, var Price): var contractIntrinsic (TRADE\*, var Price): var 

Returns the intrinsic value of the option contract per underlying unit at the 

given **Price** of the underlying. The intrinsic value of a call option is the difference between price and strike; for put options it's the difference between strike and price. A positive difference means that the option is in the money, a negative difference means it's out of the money. **Type** and **fStrike** of the contract or trade must be set; the other parameters don't matter. Source code in **contract.c**.

## contractProfit (CONTRACT\*, var Price, var Premium): var 

Returns the profit per underlying unit of a contract sold or purchased at the 

given **Premium** when expiring at the given underlying **Price**. **Premium** is positive for sold, negative for bought contracts. **Type** and **fStrike** of the contract must be set; the other parameters don't matter. Trading costs are not included. Source code in **contract.c**.

## contractMargin (CONTRACT\*, int AssetType): var 

Calculates the margin cost of the given non-covered short put/call contract for the given **AssetType** (the margin of long contracts is simply their ask price). Uses the margin formula on the Interactive Broker's **US Options Margin Requirements** page. Source code in **contract.c**.

## contractLetter (int AssetMonth): string 

Returns the letter assigned to the given expiration month (F Jan, G Feb, H Mar, J Apr, K May, M Jun, N Jul, Q Aug, U Sep, V Oct, X Nov, Z Dec). Source code 

in **contract.c**. 

## contractPrint () 

Exports the current contract chain to a **Data\\*.csv** file, for diagnostics purposes,

## contractPrint (CONTRACT\*) 

Prints the given contract parameters to the log file for diagnostics purposes, in the order Date, Type, Expiry, Strike, Underlying, Ask, Bid, fVal, fVol. 

## plotContract (int N, CONTRACT\*, var HistVol, var Min, var Max, int Days, int Modus) 

Plots the payoff diagram of **N** contracts (negative for selling) with 

volatility **HistVol** from price **Min** to price **Max**. **Modus 0** initializes the plot and plots a zero line, **Modus 1** plots the diagram at expiration, **Modus 2** at the 

given **Days** into the lifetime (**RQuantLib** required), and **Modus 3** plots the Delta. Type, strike, ask, bid, and expiry in days must be set in the **CONTRACT** struct. Source code in **contract.c**; usage example in **PayOff.c**. 

## yield(): var 

Helper function, returns the current yield rate of 3-months US treasury bills in percent. Can be used as a proxy of the risk-free interest for calculating the values of option contracts (divide it by **100** for using it in **contractVal** or **contractVol**). Works in backtest as well as live trading. Uses 

the **dataFromQuandl** function. **Zorro S** required for Quandl data access; enter your Quandl key in the **QuandlKey** field in **Zorro.ini**. Source code in **contract.c**.

## yieldCSV(): var 

As above, but gets the current yield rate from an already-downloaded treasure history in **History\FRED-DTB3.csv**.

## initRQL(): int 

Helper function that initalizes **RQuantLib**. Call this in 

the **INITRUN** when **contractVal** or **contractVol** are used. 

## *Parameters:* 

## Name  The name of the underlying, f.i. "ES" or "SPY", or the symbol - if different to the na

the name or symbol of the current asset. For contract chains in backtest mode, use the n loading monthly or daily files. 

## Handle  A number from 1...800 that identifies a previously loaded dataset containing a CON

data; or **0** for automatically loading content from a historical file or from the broker A **Mode**  **PUT|+CALL** for options, **FUTURE** for futures, **PUT+CALL+FUTURE** for options on **Type**  The exact contract type to match, a combination 

of **PUT**, **CALL**, **FUTURE**, **EUROPEAN**, **BINARY** (f.i. **PUT+EUROPEAN**), plus the follo **+ONLYW3** - select only contracts that expire at the 3rd Friday, i.e. between the 16t **+ONLYMATCH** - select only contracts that exactly match the expiration date. 

## AssetTy 1 for a currency, 2 for an index, 3 for stocks and ETFs. The margin for futures must be indi pe 

## Days  The minimum number of calendar days until expiration. The closest expiration date Expiry  The expiration date in the YYYYMMDD format. 

## Strike  Option strike price, or 0 for futures. 

## Delta  First derivative of the option value with respect to the underlying price. Determines 

change on the option value, and can serve as a proxy of the probability to expire in t

and **0..-1** for puts. 

## HistVol  The historical annualized volatility of the underlying asset, as a fraction, f.i. 0.2 for 2

the **Volatility** or **VolatilityOV** indicators from the last 20 days. For the calculation of

used instead of historical volatility. 

## Dividen The annual dividend yield of the underlying, as a fraction, f.i. 0.02 for 2% dividend y

## d 

## RiskFre The risk-free interest rate, as a fraction, f.i. yield()/100. 

## e 

## Value  The value of the option for determining the implied volatility. 

## TRADE\*  The pointer of an option or future trade. Use ThisTrade for the trade pointer in a TM *Remarks:* 

## contract.c must be included for all contract functions. The underlying asset must be selected and a contract chain must be loaded before calling a contract function. 

The **contractVal** and **contractVol** functions also require **R** with the **Rcpp** and **RQuantLib** packages that you can install from the Cran repository, either with the **install.packages** command or from the menu when using RStudio. For checking if everything is working, call a library function from the R console, like this:â¨â¨require('RQuantLib') 

AmericanOption('put', underlying=100, strike=100,                   dividendYield=0.02, riskFreeRate=0.01, maturity=0.5, volatility=0.4, 

engine='CrankNicolson') 

*Concise summary of valuation for AmericanOption* 

`  `*value  delta  gamma  vega theta rho divRho* 

*11.4122 -0.4463 0.0139  NA   NA   NA*   

*NA*â¨â¨**RQuantLib** must be initialized in the **INITRUN** by 

calling **initRQL** The current **RQuantLib** version tends to crash when a function is called with bad parameters, line negative volatility, or with a value that contradicts the strike and spot price, or with too long strike distances. After a crash, all **RQuantLib** functions return 0. 

Contract chains loaded from historical data normally contain prices, underlying, and optional data such as delta. Chains downloaded from the broker normally contain only strikes and expirations. Since loading option chains can take a **long time** (~15 minutes for long chains with some brokers), and expirations and strikes don't change intraday, it is recommended to call **contractUpdate** in live trading only once per day, preferably outside market hours. Prices can then be updated 

with **contractPrice**; prices of open trades are automatically updated**.** In test and training, **contractUpdate** should be called at any bar for updating the prices. 

Some brokers are reported to return **already-expired contracts** in their contract chain. Make sure to check the expiration date when selectiung a contract. 

## High resolution options data can be split in monthly or 

daily **.t8** files and loaded per script in a dataset that is then fed to 

the **contractUpdate** function (see example). 

## Entry, Stop, and TakeProfit limits also work for trading options and futures. They must be given as an absolute price limit to the ask price of the contract, not as a distance. When an exit limit is hit, the contract is sold at market. Of course the usefulness of stop/profit limits for option values is arguable. 

## For entering a trade, make sure that a contract is selected. Otherwise you would unwillingly open a position of the underlying. Check with contracePrice() that a nonzero ask or bid price, depending trade direction, is available for the contract or for all contracts of a combo. Set the Multiplier correctly, otherwise the backtest result will be wrong. The correct multiplier of an option or future contract can be found on the asset description on the website of the broker or the exchange. For stocks, the multiplier is normally 100. 

Underlying prices downloaded with the **assetHistory** function are normally **split and dividend adjusted** and therefore won't match strike prices. You can use the **UNADJUSTED** flag for 

downloading **unadjusted** prices instead. But often you'll need both sorts of prices in an options trading system, unadjusted prices for calculating greeks or determining strikes, and adjusted prices for historical volatility and for indicators. The usual convention is having adjusted prices 

in **.t6** history and using the **contractUnderlying()** function for the unadjusted prices. 

When an option is closed, either by an **exit** command or by reaching a stop or profit target, it is automatically **sold back or covered** at the current ask or bid price. If no market price is available, the option stays open until the next exit command or until it expires or is exercised. Options and futures can only be traded, and their prices can only be downloaded when the market is open. Do not send **enter**, **exit**, or **exercise** option positions outside market hours. 

If an option expires or is exercised, a **position of the** 

## underlying can appear. For live trading, the contractCheck command can check if an underlying position is open, and sell it automatically. In the backtest, underlying positions opened by expired or exercised options are 

immediately sold at market, and the profit or loss is booked on the account. 

For **calculating profit/loss** of an option in the backtest, the following algorithm is used:â¨- A call is assumed in the money when the strike is below the bid price (i.e. ask - spread); a put is assumed in the money when the strike is above the ask price.â¨- A long call or short put in the money buys the underlying at strike price, and sells it at bid price. The difference 

is added to or subtracted from the account.â¨- A long put or short call in the money sells the underlying at strike price, and buys it back at ask price. The difference is added to or subtracted from the account.â¨- For a long position the premium is subtracted from the account, for a short position the premium is added to the account. 

An example for finding the parameters of **commodity FOPs**. Go 

to **https://www.cmegroup.com/trading** and enter the name, for instance "Natural Gas", in the search field. A list of symbols will appear (otherwise you have to look it up at a different exhange). Select the symbol with the high trade volume, in the example "NG". Click on the link under ***Product Name***. Then select ***Contract Specs***. The multiplier (10,000 for NG) is 

the ***Contract Unit***, the pip size of the underlying is the ***Minimum Price Fluctuation*** ($0.001). Pip cost are the $0.001 in your account currency. Under ***Quotes*** you can see the current price per underlying unit ($3.146). Check if the price is in cents or dollars (see below). Under ***Margins*** you can see that the most recent November 2018 contract has $1950 maintenance margin. That's $0.195 margin cost per underlying unit. Now look up the symbol in your broker platform and check its ticker name. Check also if your broker uses the same margin. That's all you need to add the underlying to your **asset list**. The line will look like this (on an USD account): **NG,3.146,0.001,0,0,0.001,0.001,0.195,0,1,0.002,NG**. 

Futures and options on futures (FOPs) sometimes have 

prices **sometimes in cents, sometimes in dollars**, sometimes mixed in any possible combination of historical and live data. For trading with FOPs, check historical data and broker data and determine which prices - ask/bid, strike, underlying - are in cents and which in dollars. This can be different with any future and any broker. Set the **Centage** variable accordingly for using consistent dollar prices in the strategy, charts, and reports. 

The **class or root symbol** of a contract can be retrieved in live         trading from the first element of a **CONTRACT** struct: **string RootSymbol = (string)MyContract;**. Note that this only works in Live mode, as in the backtest the first CONTRACT element is the time. 

Many broker APIs, for instance **IB**, do not manage trades, but only positions. Those APIs can not distinguish between an underlying position opened by a normal trade, and a position opened by an exercised option. This must be considered in the script. Buying long and short the same contract with the same strike and expiry is treated as two different trades by Zorro, but as two positions that cancel each other by most brokers. 

Some broker APIs, for instance **IB**, need a certain "recovery time" after downloading an options chain before downloading the next chain. When downloading chains of multiple assets, **wait** some seconds 

between **contractUpdate** calls. 

Use the **exit** command if you want to close a contract by selling it or buying it back. On NFA accounts, functions 

like **contractPosition** or **contractCheck** only check the net position of open option trades, and will return wrong results when several long and short positions of the same contract are open. For the same reason, multiple scripts can trade options on the same NFA account only when they don't open the same contracts. 

## Slippage is not simulated for options. Commission and margin are set by default to the commission and margin of the underlying in the asset list, multiplied with the Multiplier. Commission is reduced by 50% when an option expires worthless. Since most brokers have different and complex calculation methods for option margins, the default margin is just an approximation. For better accuracy, use 

the **contractMargin** or **comboMargin** functions or 

calculate **Commission** and **MarginCost** parameters explicitely in the script prior to entering a trade. For instance when trading vertical spreads, margin cost is often determined by the strike price difference, therefore 

set **MarginCost = 0.5 \* (Strike1-Strike2)** before opening the two positions. The margin cost of covered contracts is usually 0. The margin requirements by IB can be found 

on **https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=24176**. 

When **optimizing** option strategies, the default **objective** function is not the ideal performance measure for options. Better is dividing the total profit by the required margin. Example:**var objective()** 

## { 

`  `**if(!NumWinTotal && !NumLossTotal) return 0;   return (WinTotal-LossTotal)/MarginMax;** 

## } 

## Phantom trades and virtual hedging are not used for contracts. Options can always be hedged regardless of the Hedge setting. 

Some historical options before 2014 expired on Saturday; afterwards they expired on Friday. Options with **Saturday expiration** are treated as if they expired on Friday. The **expiration hour** can be set up with 

the **ExpiryTime** variable. 

The **CONTRACT** struct is defined in **trading.h**. For backtests the following struct elements must be filled in the data set; for futures: **time, fAsk, fBid, Expiry, Type**; for options: **time, fAsk, fBid, fStrike, Expiry, Type**. The other **CONTRACT** elements are optional and for use in the script only. 

## contract(Contracts) selects the first contract in the chain. 

For **calculating the option value**, American options are approximated with the Crank-Nicolson method, while European options are calculated with the (much faster) Black-Scholes formula. For short-term options the results of both methods are not very different, so 

the **EUROPEAN** flag can be used in such cases even for Americon options in order to speed up the calculation. 

The **contractVol** function is known to **terminate the R** 

## session when called with unrealistic parameters, such as an unlikely small option value for a high strike-spot difference and short expiration date. This can be tested with the Rrun function ( if(!Rrun()) quit("R terminated!"); ). When the R session is terminated by an exception in the backtest, Zorro must be restarted. 

For finding the contract with the lowest strike and a particular property, start the with strike price at the current price, then 

call **contract(...)** in a loop and modify the strike in steps until the condition is fulfilled. For CALL options increase the strike, for PUT options decrease it. 

For converting dates from or to the **YYYYMMDD** format or for finding the 3rd Friday of a month, use the **dmy**, **ymd**, and **nthDay** functions. 

Several option scripts are included. The **TradeOptions** script can be used for testing the opening and closing of **SPY** options via broker API. It only runs at NY market hours and takes about 30 seconds for downloading the option chain at start. The **Payoff** script can interactively display payoff and delta diagrams of option combinations. The **OptionsCalculator** script calculates the price and delta of calls and puts, where underlying, strike, and expiration of options can be set up with sliders. Feel free to combine the scripts to your own specialized options tool.
