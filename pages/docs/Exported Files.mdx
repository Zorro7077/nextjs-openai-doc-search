## *The log* 

Zorro records script printouts and trade or other events in a **.log** file when 

the **LOGFILE** flag is set. The log contains the currrent equity and asset price at every bar, plus events such as opening or closing a trade, adjusting a trailing stop, or a **printf** message by the script. If **Verbose** is at a higher level, it also records the daily state of all open trades, the daily profit or loss, and the current drawdown depth. Event logs are normal text files and can be opened with any text editor. Their content looks like this (the messages are explained under **Log**):

The name of the log file is the script name with appended **.log** extension. If the script contains no **asset** call or if the first **printf** message precedes it, the name of the selected asset from the scrollbox is added to the log file name. Optionally a number (**LogNumber**) can be added to the file name, for comparing log files generated with different script versions. New log files overwrite old log files of the same name. For preventing that the **Log** folder gets cluttered with thousands of log files, Zorro can be set up in **Zorro.ini** to automatically delete old files. 

## *Trade lists* 

The exported trade lists - **\*\_trd.csv**, **demotrades.csv**, **trades.csv** - contain a description of every finished trade in comma separated format for import in Excel™ or other spreadsheet or database programs. They can be used for evaluating trade statistics or for the tax declaration. **\*\_trd.csv** is exported in [***Test***] mode when **LOGFILE** is set. **demotrades.csv** and **trades.csv** are exported in in [***Trade***] mode, dependent on whether a demo or real account was selected. The latter two are perpetual files, meaning that they are never overwritten, but their content is preserved and any new trade sent to the broker is just added at the end. So they will grow longer and longer until they are deleted manually or moved to a different folder. Depending on the **Comma** setting, numbers are exported with either a decimal comma or point, and separated with either a semicolon or a comma; this is because German spreadsheet programs require CSV data to be separated with semicolon. A trade spreadsheet (generated with **Comma**) looks like this: 

Meaning of the fields: 

## Name  Algo identifier (see algo), or the script name when no identifier is used. 

## Type  Trade type, Long or Short. For options, also Put or Call. 

## Asset  Traded asset. 

## ID  Trade identifier number, also used in the broker's records. 

## Lots  Number of lots. Multiply this with the asset's lot size (see above) to get the number of contr Open  Timestamp when the trade was opened, in the format Day.Month.Year Hour:Minute Close  Timestamp when the trade was closed., in the format Day.Month.Year Hour:Minute Entry  Trade fill price. If the fill price is not returned from the broker API, the ask or bid (depende

## Exit  Trade exit price. If the exit fill price is not returned from the broker API, the ask or bid (depe

## Profit  Profit or loss in units of the account currency, as returned from the broker API. Includ

slippage.

## ExitTy Sold (by exitTrade), Reverse (by enterTrade), Stop (stop loss), Target 

## pe  (profit target), Time (ExitTime), Expired (options), Exit (by a TMF that returned 1), 

or **Closed** (externally closed in the broker platform). 

## *Spreadsheets* 

The **print(TO\_CSV,...)** function offers an easy way to export backtest data or indicator values to a .csv spreadsheet in the **Log** folder. Under **Tips &** 

## Tricks some more examples can be found for exporting data to .csv files or for importing data from an external text file, for instance to set up strategy 

parameters.   

## *P&L curves* 

When the **LOGFILE** flag is set in [***Test***] or [***Trade***] mode, the daily profit and loss curve is exported at the end of the session to a **\_pnl.csv** file in the **Log** folder, and a **\_pnl.dbl** file in the **Data** folder. For this the session must have run for more than one day and at least one trade must have been executed. The files contain the daily balance or equity values in ascending date order, in text format in 

the **.csv** file, and as a **double** array in the **.dbl** file. This file is used for calculating the **Cold Blood Index** in a subsequent live trading session. Note that the array samples the values at the end of the day, so its last value is not identical to the end profit when the simulation ended before the end of the day. 

When the **EXPORT** flag is set in [***Train***] mode or for a **multi-cycle** test,  the P&L curves generated from **Parameter optimization** and from any cycle are exported separately for any asset and algo to a **\_cyc.dbl** file in the **Data** folder. The curves can be evaluated, for instance with **White's Reality Check**. The file contains multiple **double** arrays, one for any curve. The size of any curve can be determined from the size of the **\_pnl.dbl** file. 

## *Training data* 

Rules, parameters, factors, and machine learning models are exported 

to **.c**, **.par**, **.fac**, and **.ml** files in the **Data** folder. With the exception of factors, any **WFO cycle** exports a different set of files. The **.c** files contain the trained rules in C code, the **.par** and **.fac** are plain text files files containing the parameter values and factors separately for any component of the system. The **.ml** format is binary and depends on the used machine learning algorithm. 

The name of these files is affected by the **Script string**.  **Brute** 

## Force optimization exports all parameter combinations and the resulting objectives to a \*par.csv file in the Log folder. The first column contains 

the **objective** returns, the subsequent columns the parameter velues in the order of their appearance in the script. The exported spreadsheet can be evaluated by a script for generatiung heatmaps of any two parameters, or by Excel to generate a 3-d surface. Note that Excel requires re-arranging the objective column in a 2-d matrix for generating the surface. 

## *Remarks* 

Be careful when manually opening and **saving CSV files** with Excel. Dates, times, delimiters and decimal points are then possibly saved in your local format, which can cause the file to become unreadable by Zorro. 

Excel requires **exclusive access**, so Zorro cannot read or write to a file while it is open in Excel. This is indicated by an error message.
