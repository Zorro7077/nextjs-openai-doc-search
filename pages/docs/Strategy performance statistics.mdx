# ﻿Strategy performance statistics 

The following system variables can be evaluated in 

the **objective** or **evaluate** function. Some become available only at the end of a simulation or a live trading session, others are updated at any bar during the test or session. There is also a set of **trade statistics** that can be evaluated during 

the backtest. The statistics variables can be used for calculating individual performance metrics and printing them to the **performance report**.   

## DrawDownMax 

Maximum drawdown, the largest difference between a balance peak and the lowest subsequent equity valley during the simulation period, in account currency units. Updated at any bar.

## MAE 

Maximum adverse excursion, the largest difference between an equity peak and the lowest subsequent equity valley during the simulation period, in account currency units. Updated at any bar.

## AEDepth 

Current adverse excursion, the difference between the last equity peak and the current equity value, in account currency units. Updated at any bar.

## MarginMax 

Maximum margin sum of open trades during the simulation period, in account currency units. Updated at any trade.

## RiskMax 

Maximum possible loss sum of all open trades during the simulation period, in account currency units. The possible loss is calculated by the stop loss distance of a trade, or estimated at 10% of the price if no stop loss was used. Updated at any trade.

## SpreadCost 

Total loss by bid-ask spreads during the simulation period, in account currency units. Updated at any trade.

## SlippageCost 

Total win or loss by simulated slippage during the simulation period, in account currency units. Updated at any trade.

## RollCost 

Total win or loss by rollover and margin interest during the simulation period, in account currency units. Updated at any trade.

## CommissionCost 

Total loss by commissions during the simulation period, in account currency units. Updated at any trade.

## ReturnMean 

Mean of all bar returns on investment. The bar return on investment is the equity difference to the previous bar, divided by **Capital**. If **Capital** is not set, the sum of normalized maximum drawdown and maximum margin is used. Only available at the end.

## ReturnStdDev 

Standard deviation of all bar returns on investment. Can be used together with **ReturnMean** for calculating the annualized Sharpe Ratio and other metrics.Only available at the end.

## ReturnUlcer 

Ulcer Index in percent; average drawdown divided by peak equity.Only available at the end.

## ReturnR2 

R2 coefficient; the similarity of the equity curve with a straight line ending up at the same profit.Only available at the end.

## ReturnLR 

Gross profit by linear regression of the equity curve. Only available at the end. 

## ReturnCBI 

The last **CBI** value based on previously stored backtest data.Only available at the end. 

## DrawDownBars 

Total number of bars spent in drawdown, updated at any bar. For the percentage spent in drawdown, divide by the duration of the test, **(Bar-StartBar)**. 

## DrawDownBarsMax 

Maximum length of a drawdown in bars. Only available at the end. **LossStreakMax** 

Maximum number of losses in a row. Only available at the end. **NumOpenMax** 

Maximum number of simultaneously open trades. Updated at any bar. **InMarketBars** 

Total number of bars with open trades. Updated at any bar.

## InMarketSum 

Sum of the durations of all trades, in bars. Updated at any trade. Can be bigger than the duration of the test when several positions are simultaneously open. ***Type:*** 

## int for numbers that count something, otherwise var. Read/only. 

## ResultsAtBar 

Array in chronological order containing the sums of wins and losses of all open and closed trades at every bar, in account currency 

units. **(var)ResultsAtBar[Bar]** is the result at end of the simulation.*** 

## *Type:* 

## float\* pointer, or 0 when no results were calculated.

## ProfileAtBar 

Array in chronological order containing the blue equity, balance, or pip return profile at every bar. 

## DrawDownAtBar 

Array in chronological order containing the red underwater profile at every bar. ***Type:*** 

## var\* pointer, or 0 when no profile was calculated. 

## ResultsDaily 

Array in chronological order containing the balance or equity (dependent on the **BALANCE** flag) at the end of every day, in account currency 

units. **ResultsDaily[Day]** is the end result. This array is at the end of the simulation automatically saved to a **.dbl** file for the **CBI** calculation, and to a **.csv** file for further evaluation.*** 

## *Type:* 

## var\* pointer, or 0 when no daily results were calculated. *Remarks:* 

In [***Train***] mode the parameters are based on trades with 1 lot and include phantom trades, unless set up otherwise with **TrainMode**. 

More statistics parameters can be retrieved from the **win/loss statistics** at the end of the simulation. 

Trade dependent metrics can be calculated by enumerating all trades of the simulation with a **for(all\_trades)** loop, and summing up the desired **trade parameters**. Equity curve dependent metrics can be calculated from the **ResultsAtBar** or **ResultsDaily** arrays. 

All statistics variables are normally reset when the strategy is restarted or a new session is started. If the **SAV\_STATS** flag is set, statistics is continued from the previous session. 

## *Example:* 

## *// print the annualized Sharpe Ratio to the performance report*  function evaluate() 

## {  

`  `**if(NumWinTotal == 0) return;** 

`  `**var MySharpe = ReturnMean/ReturnStdDev;** 

## *// roughly adjust to annual in-market bars* 

`  `**MySharpe \*= sqrt(InMarketBars/NumYears);** 

`  `**printf(TO\_REPORT,"\nMy Sharpe: %.2f",MySharpe);** 

## }
