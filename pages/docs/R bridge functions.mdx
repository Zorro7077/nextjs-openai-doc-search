# ﻿R bridge functions 

The **r.h** header defines several functions to directly assign and read data types without the need for manually formatting and executing snippets of R code for these  purposes.  Not  all  possible  data  types  are  directly  supported,  the  main emphasis is on vectors and matrices containing floating point values. Once you have transferred the bulk of your data as vectors or matrices into the R session, you  can  execute  snippets  of  R  code  to  combine  them  or  convert  them  into something more complex if needed. 

Normally you want to get huge amounts of numeric data into the R session quickly, but not the other way. The assumption is that you want to feed it with price data on order to crunch numbers, and only need to get back a single value or a vector as a result. 

All vector functions have a parameter for the number of elements. Be careful that the array you supply has the correct size, or it will crash the R console. Expressions or code snippets have a maximum size of 1000 characters per command; larger pieces of code must be sent with several commands or - much better - be called as a function in the R environment. See **RTest.c** for example usage. 

## Rstart(string Filename, int debuglevel): int 

Start a new R session, and load R functions and variables from the 

file **Filename** in the **Strategy** folder. This must be called in the **INITRUN** before any R computations can be done. Returns **0** when the R session could not be started, otherwise nonzero. The R session will stay alive until the end of the simulation or Zorro session.***  

## *Parameters:* 

## Filename  Name of a .r file in the Strategy folder containing all needed R functions and variab

or **""** (default) for not sourcing a file. 

## debuglev 0 - only output fatal errors (default) 1 - output warnings and notes 2 - output ever el  goes to the system debug monitor. Use the free DebugView tool from Microsoft, o

## Rrun(): int 

Return **1** if the R session is ready for input, **2** if the session is busy with a computation, and **0** if the session is terminated. R will terminate on any fatal error in the code. You should check this regularly. The last command prior to the termination will be found in the debug output. If R is not running anymore, the R bridge won't emit any more messages and will silently ignore all commands. 

## Rx(string code, *int mode*): int 

Execute a line of R code. Similar to the **Ri** / **Rd** / **Rv** functions below, as evaluating an expression is also just executing code; the difference is that **Rx()** can send commands asynchronously, allows R and Zorro to do computations in parallel, and prints R output to the Zorro window. ***Parameters:*** 

## cod R code line to be executed (1000 characters max). 

## e 

## mo 0 - synchronous. Wait until the computation was finished (default). 1 - asynchronous. Retu de  used to check when the next R command can be sent. 2 - asynchronous, with a wait loop.

or **quit** with returning **0** when the session was aborted due hitting [***Stop***] or due to a fatal R a **wait** loop, and direct R **print** output to the Zorro window. The **debuglevel** must be set ac

## Rset(string name, int n) 

## Rset(string name, var d) 

## Rset(string name, var \*v, int elements) Rset(string name, var \*m, int rows, int cols) Rset(string name, string s) 

Store an int, var, series, matrix, or string in the R variable **name**. Since the target type depends on whether the variable is **int**, **var**, or a pointer, make sure to use the correct type especially when storing constants, and typecast it 

with **(int)** or **(var)** if in doubt.***  

## *Parameters:* 

## name  Name of the R variable. 

## i  int value to be assigned to a R integer variable. 

## d  var value to be assigned to a R floating point variable. 

## v  Pointer of the var array or series to be assigned to a R vector. 

## m  Pointer of the var array to be assigned to a R matrix, by row order. element Length of the vector or series. Make sure to give the exact number of s  elements. 

## rows,  Number of rows and columns of the matrix. 

## cols 

## Ri(string expression): int 

## Rd(string expression): var 

## Rv(string expression, var \*v, int elements) 

Evaluate the given R expression, and return the result as an int, double, or vector. The expression can be a single variable, a R function, or any R code that will evaluate to the required variable type.*** 

## *Parameters:* 

## expressi R expression to be evaluated (1000 characters max). 

## on 

## v  Pointer of the var array to be filled with the R vector. 

## elements  Number of elements of the vector; must be identical in the R code and in the lite-C

script. 

## *Remarks:* 

Test your R commands and functions carefully on the R console before executing them in a lite-C script. A command error - wrong syntax, a wrong path, a missing R package, or a bad parameter for a R function - will cause the session to abort and all subsequent R commands to fail. You'll normally see the error reason printed in the Zorro window. Use 

the **Rrun()** function at the end of every bar of a strategy to determine if the session is still running. When live trading, stop the strategy and raise the alarm when **Rrun()** fails. 

For checking the R console output while under lite-C control, print it to a file, f.i. with the **sink** function that prints all subsequent R output to the given file. Example: **Rx("sink(\"C:/Trading/Zorro/Log/RTest.txt\")");** 

While the R bridge is busy, Zorro can't react on user actions such as clicking the [***Stop***] button. For avoiding this on long R computations, 

use **Rx()** with **mode=2**. Alternatively, call **Rx()** with **mode=1** and 

check **Rrun()** in a **wait()** loop (f.i. **while(Rrun() == 2) wait(100)** ). 

Make sure to send complete commands. If a R command is incomplete f.i. due to a missing bracket at the end, the R session will freeze and consequently Zorro will also freeze. 

If you have the choice, perform script-based computations on the lite-C side, as lite-C is up to 200 times faster than R. Loops in R are awfully slow. However R is preferable for vector and matrix operations. 

R functions usually expect time series in straight order with newest elements last. Use the **rev** function for reversing the order of a **series**. 

When passing file names to R, use forward slashes for directories, f.i. **"C:/Project/Trading/R/Data.csv"**. You can use the **slash** helper function in **r.h** for converting backslashes to forward slashes 

(f.i. **slash(ZorroFolder)**). 

Use [***Train***] mode and **WFO** for training machine learning algorithms, f.i. a SVM or neural network. Send training data to R at the end of every WFO cycle, and store the trained models in files for later use in the [***Test***] or [***Trade***] session. The **advise(NEURAL)** function contains a framework for that. 

Install all needed R packages before starting the script. Often-used packages for financial computations are caret, zoo, xts, ttr, quantmod, rminer. There are also several popular packages for machine learning. The **e1071** package contains a support vector machine, and 

the **deepnet** package contains several deep learning network algorithms, such as sparse autoencoders and Boltzman machines. If the package of a called R function is not installed, the R session will abort with an error message. 

For conveniently working with R, we recommend the free programming environment **RStudio** (**http://www.rstudio.org**) that contains a simple debugger. 

The **R lectures** by Harry Georgakopoulos have been included in this manual. There are also several e-books about R (f.i. **R in a nutshell**). Scanning through a R book or tutorial is highly recommended, as it takes a while to get used to the R language. Variables are generated by assignment, and need not be declared. The most common variables are 

a **numeric** (= var, int, bool), a **vector** (= series, array), a **matrix** (= two-dimensional array), a **data frame** (= array of structs), and a **list** (= arbitrary collection of data). A series element can be accessed by appending **[n]** just as in lite-C, but in R the index begins with **1**, not with **0**. List elements are indexed with double brackets **[[n]]**. Although R also recognizes the '=' assignment operator, R assignments are usually made with '<-' or '->' depending on the assignment direction. Functions can write into global variables with '<<-'. Boolean operators are similar to C, but mind the difference between '&' and '&&': the former operates on all vector elements, the latter only on the first - a common trap for C programmers who write their first R code.
