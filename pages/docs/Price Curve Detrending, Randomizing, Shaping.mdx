# ï»¿Price  Curve  Detrending,  Randomizing, Shaping 

When developing, testing, or training systems, it is often very useful to modify price curves, **randomize** price data, or **remove trend** from trades, indicators, or trained parameters. This allows training or testing strategies under defined conditions, such as with no trend, with artificial trend, or with artificial price peaks or drops. Randomized price curves can be used for Monte Carlo evaluations 

or **reality checks**. Backtesting with detrended or inverted price curves is a quick check to verify the validity and robustness of a strategy.

One variable does it all: 

## Detrend 

Accepts the flags below for detrending or other manipulations of the price curves or of trades, indicators, or trained parameters. The flags can be set with **Detrend = Flag;** or **setf(Detrend,Flag);**. Flags can be combined with '+' or '|':*** 

## *Range:* 

## TRADES  Detrend trade results. The trade return is corrected by a facto

slope of the current WFO cycle. This removes trend bias fro properties of the price curve. 

## PRICES  Detrend trade results and price functions, as well as indicator

corrrection factor as above is added to the returned prices. T starts and ends at the same price, and detrends indicators a generated with **price()** calls. 

## CURVE  Detrend historical price data on loading. The curve is tilted so 

historical data are at the same level. This also affects the dis **RECIPROCAL**  Replace historical prices with their reciprocal values. This it ca

## INVERT  Similar to RECIPROCAL, but keep the price range while in

Generate a random walk price curve by moving the price in r original volatility. Removes any market inefficiency out of the Generate a random walk price curve that does not exceed t price curve, or/and does not fall below zero.

## *Type:* int 

## Shape 

Pointer to a 0-terminated array of price values for applying a shape to the price curve when **Detrend = SHAPE** is set. All prices of the array are placed in equal distances, and the price curve is bent so that it touches any of them. The more prices in the array, the closer is the curve adapted to the given shape. The last array element must be **0** for indicating the end (see example).*** 

## *Type:* 

## var\* *Remarks:* 

All price curve manipulating flags must be 

set **before** calling **asset()** the first time. Use **setf** or **resf** for setting or resetting single flags, while keeping the other flags unchanged. 

All price curve manipulations are normally applied to the **whole price curve** on the ticks level, including lookback, in sample, out of sample, and skipped periods. If a particular **StartDate** is set, 

the **SHAPE** begins at that date and ends at a given **EndDate** (if 

any). **TRADES** or **PRICES** detrends the prices from the end of the current lookback period until the end of the current WFO test or training cycle. This has the effect that all WFO cycles are separately detrended in [***Train***] mode. **Detrend** = **CURVE** however detrends the whole price curve, but does not affect the local trends within the WFO cycles. 

## SHUFFLE generates curves with similar start and end points as the original curves. BOOTSTRAP and RANDOMWALK generate curves with a similar start point, but modified end points. CURVE generates curves with a similar end point, but modified start point. 

## SHUFFLE and BOOTSTRAP randomize the the bar ranges (high-low difference) and changes (center price difference to the previous bar) independently, using the Lehmer random number algorithm. The resulting curves have similar magnitude, volatility, and long term trend as the original curve, but all bar correlations are removed. 

## SHUFFLE, BOOTSTRAP, RANDOMWALK, SHAPE, and CURVE c an produce negative prices on curves with large price volatility. In that case CURVE clips negative prices and produces a flat price line close to zero at those curve parts. SHUFFLE automatically generates a new curve when prices are negative. The PEAK and VALLEY** flags keep shuffled curves inside the maximum and minimum of the original curve, and bootstrapped curves between zero and twice the original maximum. This can delay the bar generation when the curve randomizing process must be often repeated. 

If a trade strategy has **trend bias** - f.i. when it buys more long than short positions, or vice versa - it is normally recommended to remove the trend from the price curve for training the strategy parameters. Otherwise the simulation will be too optimistic when the price curve has an overall upwards trend, or too pessimistic when it has a downwards trend. For symmetric strategies that buy long and short positions under similar conditions and with the same parameters, detrending is normally not necessary. 

For detrending only strategy parameters or machine learning              models, but not the test results, set **Detrend** only in [***Train***] mode: **if(Train) Detrend = CURVE;**. For detrending only the prices of certain assets, 

set **Detrend** before calling that **asset()** in the initial run, and reset it 

to **0** afterwards. For detrending particular trades only, set **Detrend = TRADES** before entering the trade, and set **Detrend = 0** afterwards. This can be useful for testing portfolio systems that use both trend following and non-trend algorithms. 

For determining if a system's profit is caused by artifacts, temporarily set **Detrend = SHUFFLE+CURVE** and test. If the profit is caused by a real edge, it should then disappear. For determining if a system's profit is caused by randomness, temporarily set **Detrend = INVERT** and test. On symmetric assets such as currencies, the system should then still achieve profits. 

Modified price curves can be exported to a CSV file for further tests with Excel, R, or similar statistical software. 

Reality checks using inverted or randomized price curves are mentioned on **Financial Hacker | Development Process | Step 7: Reality Check**.
