## predictMove (vars Data, int Length, int Horizon, var Percentile): var 

Predicts the magnitude of a price movement, based on statistical analysis of price changes in the **Data** series. Returns the given **Percentile** of **Data** changes within the given time **Horizon**. Example: if the function returns **10** at **Horizon = 20** and **Percentile = 95**, then in **95%** of all cases the **Data** value moved by **10** or less in any direction within **20** bars (and therefore moved by more than **10** only in **5%** of all cases). For statistical significance **Length** should be large compared to **Horizon**. 

## predictSeason (vars Data, int Length, int Horizon, int Season): var 

Predicts the expected price movement within a given time **Horizon**, based on the current time and seasonal movement in the **Data** series. Example: if the function returns **1.5** at **Horizon = 20** and **Season = 4**, then the **Data** series is expected to rise by **1.5** within 20 bars from now, based on the annual movement at the same date in previous years. If **Horizon == 0**, the function returns no price move, but the average seasonal **Data** value at the current date. For statistical significance the **Data** series should cover at least 3 or 4 seasons.***  

## *Returns:* 

Predicted data change / average seasonal data. ***Parameters:*** 

## Data  A data series, usually from price functions price(), priceClose(),  

## Length  The length of the data series, normally the LookBack period. 

## Horizon  Price movement duration in bars. 

## Percenti Price movement percentile to return, f.i. 5 for the lowest 5% or 95 for the highest le  5%. 

## Season  1 for daily, 2 for weekly, 3 for monthly, or 4 for annual seasons. 

## *Remarks:* 

Source code in **indicators.c**. 

Use **plotDay**, **plotWeek**, **plotMonth**, or **plotYear** for displaying seasonal dependence in a histogram. 

## *Example:* 

## function run() 

## { 

`  `**StartDate = 2010;   BarPeriod = 1440;   LookBack = 300;**  

`  `**vars Prices = series(price());** 

`  `**if(!is(LOOKBACK)) {** 

`    `**LifeTime = 1;** 

`    `**var WeeklyMove = predictSeason(Prices,LookBack,LifeTime,2);     if(WeeklyMove > 0)** 

`      `**enterLong();** 

`    `**else if(WeeklyMove < 0)** 

`      `**enterShort();** 

`  `**}**
