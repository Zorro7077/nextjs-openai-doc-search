# ï»¿Normalization functions 

The following functions can be used for normalizing and compressing time series or indicator values to a range that's independent of the asset and time frame. They suppress long-term trend and emphasize short cycles in various ways. Normalization is often required for **machine learning** algorithms.

## center (var Value, int TimePeriod): var 

Centers **Value** by subtracting its median over the **TimePeriod**. Using the median instead of the mean reduces the effect of outliers.

## compress (var Value, int TimePeriod): var 

Compresses **Value** to the -100...+100 range. For this, **Value** is divided by its interquartile range - the difference of the 75th and 25th percentile - taken over **TimePeriod**, and then compressed by a **cdf** function. Works best when **Value** is an oscillator that crosses the zero line. Formula: **200 \* cdf(0.25\*Value/(P75-P25)) - 100**.

## scale (var Value, int TimePeriod): var 

Centers and compresses **Value** to the -100...+100 scale. The deviation of **Value** from its median is divided by its interquartile range and then compressed by a **cdf** function. Formula: **200 \* cdf(0.5\*(Value-Median)/(P75-P25)) - 100**.

## normalize (var Value, int TimePeriod): var 

Normalizes **Value** to the -100...+100 range by subtracting its minimum and dividing by its range over **TimePeriod**. Formula: **200 \* (Value-Min)/(Max-Min) - 100** . For a 0..100 oscillator, multiply the returned value with 0.5 and add 50. 

## zscore (var Value, int TimePeriod): var 

Calculates the Z-score of the **Value**. The Z-score is the deviation from the mean over the **TimePeriod**, divided by the standard deviation. 

Formula: **(Value-Mean)/StdDev**. 

## *Parameters:* 

## Value - Variable, expression, or indicator to be normalized. TimePeriod - Normalization period.*** 

## *Returns:* 

Normalized **Value**. ***Remarks:*** 

The above functions generate **series** and thus must be called in a 

fixed order in the script. 

For converting a value **X** from a -100.+100 range to a 0...**Y** range, use the expression **Y\*(X+100)/200**. 

There are other functions for compressing data series in various ways: **tanh** compresses to the -1..1 range, **sigmoid** (= **1./(1.+exp(-x))** ) compresses to the 0..1 range, **Normalize** and **AGC** compress data series to -1..+1, **PercentRank** compresses to 0..100, and **FisherN** compresses so that most values fall inside -1.5..+1.5. 

## *Example:* 

## function run() 

## { 

`  `**set(PLOTNOW);** 

`  `**PlotWidth = 600;** 

`  `**PlotHeight1 = PlotHeight2;** 

`  `**PlotBars = 400;** 

`  `**LookBack = 200;** 

`  `**var ATR100 = ATR(100);** 

`  `**plot("ATR 100",ATR100,NEW,RED);** 

`  `**plot("center",center(ATR100,100),NEW,RED);** 

`  `**plot("compress",compress(ATR100-0.003,100),NEW,RED);   plot("scale",scale(ATR100,100),NEW,RED);** 

`  `**plot("normalize",normalize(ATR100,100),NEW,RED);** 

`  `**plot("zscore",zscore(ATR100,100),NEW,RED);** 

## }
