# ï»¿Performance Report 

Zorro can analyze the performance of its own strategy scripts, and of strategy results from other platforms that are imported from **.csv** trade lists. A click on [***Result***] after a test run produces a **chart**, a **log**, a trade list in CSV format, and a performance report with portfolio analysis. Chart images and reports are stored in the **Log** folder and can be displayed with Zorro's image viewer or text editor. Exported charts are **.png** image files, generated reports are simple **.txt** files. This way they can be easily posted to websites, imported in documents, exported to spreadsheets, or further evaluated with the **Performance** script. Additionally, datasets from charts can also be **exported** and further evaluated with third party software, f.i. an **R data analysis** package. 

During a session, the performance report is available through the **report** function. In [***Trade***] mode the chart and performance report is part of the **.htm** status page. It can be displayed in a web browser and is updated every minute. It also contains a list of all open and pending trades, as well as any specific information that is **printed** by the script. 

This is an example of a performance report: **Walk-Forward Test Z4 portfolio**

When developing a strategy, don't look only into the performance report. Especially when results are unexpected or affected by parameters in strange ways, **look into the log file** and examine the single trades. This is often more informative than the performance summary. 

To **speed up** the performance report generation especially on backtests with a large number of bars or trades, disable Montecarlo permutations ( **MonteCarlo = 0;** ) and OptimalF factor calculation 

( **set(NOFACTORS);** ). 

Additional performance figures of any kind can be added to the report with a **print(TO\_REPORT, ...)** command. All trades are stored and can be enumerated in a (**for(all\_trades)**) loop in the **evaluate** function. The daily equity or balance curve is available in the **ResultsDaily** array for further calculations. Graphical presentations of performance parameters can be produced with **plotBar** statements. Examples can be found in 

the **include\profile.c** file. If you need a certain performance parameter that can not be easily generated by script, please ask for it on the Zorro user 

forum. 

Most performance parameters above are only valid when the **result is positive**. and **profits are not reinvested**. If the **Capital** variable is set, Zorro assumes profit reinvesting. This affects the maximum drawdown and invalidates all drawdown-dependent performance parameters such as required capital, annual return, OptimalF factors, Monte Carlo analysis, and to some degree, Sharpe ratio. Therefore, have **Capital** at zero when testing the basic performance of your strategy; and enable reinvesting it only at the end for testing the money management. 

In backtest and training, performance is normally calculated under the assumption of **constant spread, commission, slippage, rollover, and account currency exchange rate**, which are all taken from the **asset list**. Theoretically the performance could be adapted to variations in those 

parameters as in the example under **PipCost**. But this is only recommended in special cases, because the result differences are not relevant for the strategy performance, but would add artifacts to the test and training process. 

When the backtest runs over several **sample cycles**, the price curve in the chart only shows the trades of the last cycle, but the performance report and the equity curve are calculated from all cycles. If some cycles win and others lose, the summing up can generate results that appear inconsistent, for instance a small positive **Sharpe ratio**, but a small negative **Annual return**. 

The performance report differentiates between **Maximum                 Drawdown** and **Maximum Adverse Excursion (MAE)**. The drawdown is the important parameter; it reduces the free margin on your account and can cause a **margin call**. The MAE has no direct effect on your account. Darawdown and MAE can be substantially different, especially when open trades undergo high volatilty periods.â¨**Example**: A single trade first goes up to $3000 profit, then falls down to -$1000 loss, then goes up again and 

is closed at $500 profit. This trade has a MAE of -$4000, but only a drawdown of -$1000. You need a capital of at least $1000 plus the position margin for avoiding a margin call. Drawdown is dangerous, MAE is not (except for your nerves). Your capital requirement normally depends on the maximum drawdown. But when you observe a high difference between MAE and maximum drawdown, try improving the trade exit algorithms. 

## Maximum drawdown and MAE depend on the test period; longer test periods cause higher maximum drawdown. On a break-even system the maximum drawdown is proportional to the square root of the test period\*. For this reason, drawdown dependent performance figures such as Annual return and Capital required are calculated from 

a **normalized drawdown**, which adjusts the drawdown to 3 years. For this, the drawdown is multiplied with the square root of 3 years divided by the test period. This results in performance figures that are largely independent on the test period. 

## Maximum drawdown and MAE are a result of the random win/loss pattern of trades. They can change greatly with minor changes to the strategy or test period; therefore all performance parameters calculated from the original equity curve are subject to randomness. For better accuracy, use Monte Carlo Simulation. 

The **Capital required** is a statistical parameter calculated from the simulation. It is unrelated to the **Risk** displayed by Zorro for single trades, which is the maximum loss when hitting the initial stop. The **Max open risk** parameter and even an individual trade **Risk** can be higher than the required capital. Do not take the **Capital required** parameter as a guaranteed loss limit! 

The **Ulcer index** is traditionally calculated from percentages of 

equity retracements from their preceding equity peaks 

(formula: **https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcer\_index**). This can produce misleading results, since the equity peaks normally rise during the trade period. The ulcer index is then mostly affected by the begin of the equity curve where the peaks are lower and the percentages higher. For this reason, Zorro calculates a **modified ulcer index** that takes the retracement percentages from the maximum equity peak of the backtest. 

The **Sharpe ratio** takes risk into account; it is supposed to compare the strategy performance with a risk-free return as from a savings account. A Sharpe ratio of 1.5 would be equivalent to a savings account with 50% risk-free interest. Traditionally, 4% are subtracted from the Sharpe ratio for obtaining the difference to the usual 4% interest of risk-free investment returns. This would make no sense for comparing trade strategies, thus risk-free interest is not subtracted here. 

The **Sortino ratio** differs from the Sharpe ratio in using only the standard deviation of below-mean returns (semi-deviation). It is often considered to measure risk better than the Sharpe ratio. 

The **R2** coefficient is a measure of the upwards tendency of the equity curve. For this the equity curve is compared with a straight line through its start and end points (not with its own regression line as in some applications, as this could feign a high linearity even with a falling equity curve). R2 is the squared correlation coefficient of real curve and straight slope. A equity curve with no significant upwards tendency produces a R2 coefficient of zero. 

Large portfolio strategies with thousands of assets and trades 

can **take a long time** for calculating **OptimalF** factors. If not needed, 

use **setf(TrainMode,SETFACTORS**) for disabling 

the **OptimalF** calculation.. 

The per-asset and per-algo figures in the portfolio analysis are          simple non-weighted averages of the components. Thus, low-volume         components contribute overproportionally and the weights won't add up to 

100%. 

Keep in mind that that all those performance figures are derived from historical data (even when it's out-of-sample data). **The future is unknown**, so there is no guarantee to achieve the same performance in live trading. Many figures - f.i. Sharpe ratio, Monte Carlo analysis, drawdown extrapolation, R2 coefficient - are based on mathematical models that assume a Gaussian distribution of returns. However there is no guarantee that real returns always follow a Gaussian distribution. For those reasons, don't interpret too much into performance figures. Even a system with excellent theoretical performance can cause real loss of money.
