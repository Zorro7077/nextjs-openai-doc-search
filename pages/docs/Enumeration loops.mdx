# ï»¿Enumeration loops 

## for(current\_trades) { ... } 

A **for** loop that cycles through all open and pending trades with the 

current **asset** and **algo**, starting with the earliest trade; useful f.i. for closing trades in a FIFO compliant way.

## for(last\_trades) { ... } 

A **for** loop that cycles backwards through the internal list of open, pending, closed, and cancelled trades with the current **asset** and **algo**, starting with the last trade.

## for(open\_trades) { ... } 

A **for** loop that cycles through all open and pending trades of all assets and algos, starting with the earliest trade.

## for(closed\_trades) { ... } 

A **for** loop that cycles backwards through all closed trades of all assets and algos, starting with the latest trade.

## for(all\_trades) { ... } 

A **for** loop that cycles through the internal list of all trades; useful for a detailed trade statistic after the simulation.

## for(past\_trades) { ... } 

A **for** loop that cycles backwards through the internal list of all trades, starting with the latest trade; useful for equity curve trading.

## for(listed\_assets) { ... } 

A **for** loop that cycles through all assets from the **asset list**, in the same order as in the list. This is basically the same as **for(i=0; Assets[i]; i++) { Asset = Assets[i]; ... }** .

## for(used\_assets) { ... } 

A **for** loop that cycles through all assets used in the script in alphabetical order, by selecting one after the other.

## for(all\_algos) { ... } 

A **for** loop that cycles through all asset/algo combinations used in the script, by selecting one component after the other, 

## break\_trades break\_assets break\_algos 

Special **break** macros for aborting a trade, asset, or algo enumeration loop. Use **return\_trades** for returning from inside a trade loop. All macros are defined in **variables.h**.*** 

## *Type:* 

## Macro *Remarks:* 

The above enumeration loops are **macros** defined 

in **include\variables.h**. Unlike a normal **for** loop, enumeration loops cannot be nested, and they must not be aborted 

by **break** or **return** statements. 

The **break\_trades**, **break\_assets**, **break\_algos** macros can be used to abort these loops. The asset list can alternatively be enumerated, with no restrictions, with a normal loop like this: **for(i=0; Assets[i]; i++) { asset(Assets[i]); ... }** ). 

The predefined **Itor** variable starts at **0** and is incremented at any loop. It can be used for counting cycles or indexing arrays. 

The asset that was selected at loop begin is stored 

in **AssetPrev** and automatically re-selected after the end of the loop. 

Trades are sorted in the order of entering, either forwards or backwards dependent on loop type. 

The code inside a **for(...trades)** loop sets the **ThisTrade** pointer to the loop trade and has access to all its **trade variables**. When called inside a **TMF**, all **trade variables** inside the enumeration loop refer to the current loop trade, while outside the loop they refer to the trade of the TMF. All asset specific variables in the trade loop - **Asset**, **Spread**, etc. - are set to the trade asset. Algo specific variables (f.i. **AlgoVar**) and component specific variables (f.i. **trade statistics**) are **not set up** in the loop; if this is desired, call **algo(TradeAlgo)** inside a trade loop. 

Asset loops select the asset name and parameters, but don't initialize the asset or load its history. Call **asset(Asset)** and/or **algo(...)** for evaluating component specific **trade statistics** in the loop. 

Use an **if(TradeIsPending)**, **if(TradeIsOpen)**, 

or **if(TradeIsClosed)** condition, or a combination of them, to filter out the desired trades in a trade enumeration loop. When **virtual hedging** is used, **open\_trades** includes phantom as well as pool trades. Make sure to distinguish them with **if(TradeIsPool)**. You don't want to modify pool 

trades. 

Enumeration loops must normally not modify themselves. For instance, a loop over all open trades must not change the number of open trades. As an exception, a new trade can be opened inside a trade enumeration loop. But since this will add a new cycle to that loop, be careful not to create an endless loop this way. It is also allowed to close the current trade in the loop by **exitTrade(ThisTrade)**. 

## *Example:* 

## *// find all pending trades with the current asset and all algos* int numPending(bool isShort) 

## { 

`  `**int num = 0;** 

`  `**for(open\_trades)** 

`    `**if(0 == strcmp(Asset,AssetPrev)**  

`      `**&& TradeIsPending && TradeIsShort == isShort)** 

`        `**num++;** 

`  `**return num;** 

## } 

## *// sum up the profit/loss of all open trades with the current asset* 

## var val = 0; 

## for(open\_trades) 

`  `**if(0 == strcmp(Asset,AssetPrev) && TradeIsOpen && !TradeIsPhantom)** 

`    `**val += TradeProfit;** 

## *// increase the stop of all winning trades slowly over time* for(open\_trades) { 

`  `**if(TradeIsOpen && TradeProfit > 0 && !TradeIsPool)** 

`    `**TradeStopLimit -= 0.02 \* TradeStopDiff;** 

## } 

## *// lock 80% profit of all winning trades* for(open\_trades) { 

`  `**if(TradeIsOpen && !TradeIsPool && TradeProfit > 0) {     TradeTrailLock = 0.80;** 

`    `**if(TradeIsShort)** 

`      `**TradeTrailLimit = max(TradeTrailLimit,TradePriceClose);** 

`    `**else** 

`      `**TradeTrailLimit = min(TradeTrailLimit,TradePriceClose);** 

`  `**}** 

## } 

## *// sum up open profits of all assets and the current algo* var ProfitSum = 0; 

## for(used\_assets) { 

`  `**asset(Asset); *// select the current component*** 

`  `**ProfitSum += ProfitOpen;** 

## }
