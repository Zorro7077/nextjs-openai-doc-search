# ﻿Plot functions 

Zorro can generate charts, histograms, or scatter plots, and export the data in CSV or image format for further evaluation. The **profile library** contains often-used functions for diagrams. The following plot commands are available:

## plot(string Name, var Value, int Type, int Color) plot(string Name, vars Data, int Type, int Color) 

Plots a variable, or the first element of the **Data** series, on the current bar position on the **chart**. The value can be plotted as a dot, line, bar, or band, dependent on **Type**. The plot is linked to the current asset. 

## plotBar(string Name, int Pos, var Label, var Value, int Type, int Color) 

Adds a value to a given x axis position in a histogram. A histogram consists of vertical bars that display the sum, average, standard deviation, maximum, or minimum of the values added to any x position. It can be exported to a CSV file for further evaluation.

## plotHistogram(string Name, var Value, var Step, var Weight, int Color): int 

Variant of **plotBar** for plotting a histogram bar. The **Value** range is dividied in equidistant **Step**s. Bars belonging to the same **Step** are accumulated by adding their **Weight**s. Returns the x axis position of the bar.

## plotGraph(string Name, var X, var Y, int Type, int Color) 

Plots a dot, symbol, line, spline, or polygon at a given **X,Y** position with the given **Color** either to the current chart, to the current histogram created 

by **plotBar**, or to a scatter plot when **Type** was combined with **GRAPH**. Call this function to mark certain events in the price chart.

## plotText (string Name, var X, var Y, string Text, int Style, int Color) 

Displays the **Text** with the given **Color** at a given **X,Y** relative or absolute position (dependent on **Style**, see below)  on the current chart, scatter plot, or histogram. Text on relative positions scrolls with the other chart elements and is only visible when the chart is above a zoom factor determined by **PlotText**.

## plotData (string Name): DATA\* 

Returns a pointer to the **DATA** struct with the data stored by a chart plot or histogram with the given **Name**. The **DATA** struct is defined 

in **include\trading.h**. **DATA->Data[DATA->start]** is the first valid data point, and **DATA->Data[DATA->end]** is the last. The data points are in chronological order. **DATA->Data[n]** is the data point at bar number **n**, and its timestamp is 

therefore **wdateBar(n)**. The function can be used for retrieving the plot curve, for analyzing it, for modifying data before plotting, or for exporting it to other charting tools.

## plotChart (string FileName) 

Generates a chart or histogram from the previous **plot** calls, and displays it with the **chart viewer** or stores it in a **.png** file with the 

given **FileName** when **PL\_FILE** is set. Exports it to a CSV file 

when **PL\_EXPORT** is set. Deletes all plot elements so that new plots can be built afterwards. Use this function to update charts or histograms in real time 

(see **PayOff.c**). If this function is not used, the chart is generated at the end of a backtest or when clicking [***Result***]. 

Chart with candles and indicators, created with **plot** commands Autocorrelation histogram created with **plotBar** commands MAE scatter plot, created with **plotGraph** commands.

## *Parameters:*

## Styl Text style; all texts with the same Name must have the same Style. Text centered = 0 (defa e  Bottom Center = 2, Bottom Right = 3, Left = 4, Right = 6, Top Left = 7, Top Center = 8, T

absolute **X,Y** pixel position (0,0 = upper left corner of the chart). Add **64** for text on a white bold text. 

## Col Color and transparency of the data curve, bar, symbol, or text, in the format as described un or  histogram or scatter plot can have different colors; on a chart all elements with the same

If at **0**, nothing is plotted, but the data is stored for later analyzing it by **plotData**. Use the ranges, and the **plot2** function for plotting curves in two colors. 

## *Remarks:* 

In [***Test***] mode the **chart viewer** either appears automatically after the test, or at pressing [***Result***], dependent on **PLOTNOW**. In [***Trade***] mode the live chart is updated in intervals given by on **PlotPeriod**. In [***Train***] mode no charts are plotted; instead parameter histograms or countour charts are displayed in a browser. Histograms show the objective value and the number of winning and losing trades for each parameter. 

Histograms, scatter plots, and charts can not be plotted at the same time; **plotBar** overrides **plot**. 

The vertical axis of charts and histograms is **automatically** 

## scaled so that all elements are visible. This can cause 'compressed lines' when elements are too far apart or at wrong positions, for instance a plot at position 0 on a chart with a 1.1 - 1.2 price range. Elements 

by **plotGraph** can affect the scale even when they are outside the visible chart section. If a plot curve appears **compressed** or **vertically shifted**, it has likely initial values outside their normal range. For avoiding this, start the plots after the lookback period ( **if(!is(LOOBACK)) { plot(...); }** ). 

When **extra charts** are opened with **NEW**, the order of **plot** calls determines in which chart the curves are plotted. The order is determined by the first **plot** call in or after the **FIRSTRUN**. Subsequent calls can then be in arbitrary order. When plot order matters and plots depend 

on **if(...)** conditions, enforce the right order in the first run f.i. 

with **if(is(FIRSTRUN))**. Candles and bands are only plotted in the main chart. 

If **plot** is called several times with the same **Name** at the same bar, only the last data value is plotted. 

If a **plot** command is not called during a bar, the plotted curve 

will **have gaps** at the skipped bars. This can be used for plotting dotted lines. Example for plotting only at every second bar in a chart: **if(Bar%1) plot(...);.** 

Every plot on a chart must have the same **Type** and **Color**. For plotting a curve in different colors, use alternating curves with the same value and different **Name**. In a histogram, any graph or symbol can have an individual color. 

## plotGraph and plotText limit to the number of elements (lines, symbols, texts) per plot to the number of bars on the chart. Exceeding the limit causes an Error 038 message. For adding more elements to the chart, use another plotGraph with a different Name. 

Any **plot** command is normally **linked to the current asset**. 

When **multiple assets** are traded, only prices, trades, and curves linked to the asset selected with the [***Asset***] scrollbox are plotted; curves linked to other assets are only plotted when **PlotMode** got set to **PL\_ALL**. For plotting parameters of different assets together, store them in different variables and then plot all together without calling **asset()** inbetween. For instance, inside an **asset loop** you can store them in a **var** array with one element per asset, then plot all elements of the array after the asset loop. The curves are then visible on the chart when you select the last asset of the loop and click [***Result***]. 

For **removing chart elements** such as price candles or equity curves, set their **Color** to 0. 

Use the **color** function for setting **color ranges** in multicolor               histograms. An example can be found in **profile.c** for the heatmap plotting. 

Use **plotData** for evaluating or modifying plots. 

Set the **EXPORTED** flag for **exporting** charts and histograms to 

a **\*\_plot.csv** file in the **Log** folder. They can then be displayed with other charting software. 

For **adjusting** scale, colors, symbol sizes, x axis labels etc, set up the corresponding **plot variable**. 

## Special histograms, such as trade profiles, MAE graphs, seasonal profiles, correlograms or heatmaps can be plotted with the functions from the profile library. 

Price curves can be plotted even without a **run** function - f.i. 

for **HFT** simulation - when the bars are increased by **priceQuote**. Make sure that the **plot** function is then called at every bar for avoiding gaps in 

the curve. 

Use **dataChart** for plotting a contour chart of a complete dataset.
