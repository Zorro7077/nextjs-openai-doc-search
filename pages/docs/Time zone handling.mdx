# ï»¿Time zone handling 

Zorro's standard time zone is UTC (Greenwich mean time), which is also the time zone of historical data, logs, and charts. **Time and date functions** and variables are normally also based on UTC time. Alternatively, local time zones can be used either on the bar or on the asset level. For handling or converting time zones, the following variables are available: 

## BarZone 

Time zone of bars (default: **UTC**). Affects bar generation: daily bars will start and end at **BarZone** midnight plus **BarOffset**. For this, set **BarZone** before the 

first **asset** call. **BarZone** is also used by several date/time functions that use local time. For using specific asset-dependent time zones with intraday bars, see **AssetFrameZone** and **AssetMarketZone**. 

## HistoryZone 

Time zone of the historical data files, for converting them to **UTC**. This variable is rarely needed since timestamps in historical data files should be already in UTC. If not, set **HistoryZone** to the time zone in the data. The time stamps in historical data files and **dataset** files are then automatically converted to UTC 

on **dataLoad** or **dataParse**.

## BrokerZone 

Time zone of the broker plugin. This variable is rarely needed since broker plugins normally return timestamps in UTC. Otherwise the broker plugin is supposed to set **BrokerZone** with the **GET\_BROKERZONE** command. The broker API time stamps are then converted to UTC on import.

## LogZone 

Time zone of the log and chart. If not set, all dates and times in the log and chart are in UTC. 

## AssetMarketZone 

Time zone of the current **asset**; initally read from the **Market** field of the **asset list**, otherwise copied from **BarZone** or set by script.

## AssetFrameZone 

Time zone of the current **asset** for daily trading; used to set **AssetFrame** to a daily **TimeFrame** that begins at **FrameOffset** in local time.***  

## *Type:* 

## int, UTC for UTC time (default), EST for New York, WET for London, CET for Frankfurt, AEST for Sydney, JST for Tokyo, or any number from -23..+23 that gives the time zone offset in hours to UTC. Daylight saving time is used, except for UTC and for time zones at or beyond JST. 

## AssetFrame 

Asset specific time frame, automatically set by **AssetFrameZone**. **0** when the current **asset** had no price quotes in the current bar or when its market is closed; negative number of skipped bars when the market opens; **1** otherwise. Normally used to set **TimeFrame** **= AssetFrame** for skipping bars outside market hours, or for trading on different time zones (see example).***  

## *Type:* 

## int, read/only *Remarks:* 

## BarZone, HistoryZone, and BrokerZone affect the sampling of bars and thus must be set before loading history with the first asset() call. The asset-specific AssetZone and AssetMarket must be set after selecting the asset and can be changed at runtime. 

If backtests use price history in local time and no time zone is set, all time/date functions and variables are then also in local time instead of UTC.  

Setting a non-UTC **BarZone** generates a daily bar of 23 or 25 hours when the daylight saving period begins or ends. The **run** function can run twice or be skipped when the clock is set backwards or forwards. This should be taken into account in strategies that strongly rely on a 24-hour bar period or on bars ending or starting at a certain time. 

For emulating day bars of different assets with different time zones, use 1-hour bars with **AssetFrameZone** and **AssetFrame** (see example). Use **FrameOffset** for starting the emulated bar at a certain local hour. 

## *Examples:* 

## *// trade daily at 15:30 New York time* BarPeriod = 1440; 

## BarOffset = 15\*60+30; 

## BarZone = EST; 

## ... 

## *// trade two assets on different time zones* 

## BarPeriod = 60; 

## FrameOffset = 10; *// trade both assets at 10:00 am local time* while(asset(loop("EUR/USD","USD/JPY"))) 

## { 

`  `**if(strstr(Asset,"EUR"))** 

`    `**AssetFrameZone = WET;** 

`  `**else if(strstr(Asset,"JPY"))** 

`    `**AssetFrameZone = JST;** 

`  `**TimeFrame = AssetFrame; *// use a daily time frame changing at 10:00 local time*** 

`  `**...** 

## } 

## NumBars 

Total number of bars in the simulation, determined 

from **Lookback**, **StartDate** and **EndDate** and from the available data in the price history files. Is **0** in the initial run before the first **asset** call.

## NumTicks 

Total number of ticks processed in the simulation, determined from the price history resolution. Is **0** in the initial run before the first **asset** call.

## Bar 

Current bar number including the lookback period and preceding history, usually from **0** to **NumBars-1**. The number is not necessarily counted up straight since bars can be skipped (see remarks).

## StartBar 

Number of the first bar after the **lookback** period. **(Bar-StartBar)** is the current duration of the test or trade period in bars. **(StartBar-LookBack)** is the number of the first bar after the **INITRUN**.

## EndBar 

Number of the last bar.

## AssetFirstBar 

Number of the first valid bar of the selected asset. Can be different for asset whose histories begin later than the initial bar. 

## Day 

Current trading day number of the simulation, starting with the end of the lookback period. Periods with no bars, such as weekends and holidays, are skipped.*** 

## *Type:* 

## int, read/only *Remarks:* 

## NumBars and StartBar are only valid after the asset history was 

loaded. 

The **Bar** number is normally increased by **1** on every **run**, but there are exceptions. When the simulation starts at a certain **StartDate** or when **WFO** cycles are trained, bars from the price history preceding 

the **LookBack** period are skipped and **Bar** can start with a high number after the initial run. **Bar** can even 'jump back' at the begin of any backtest WFO cyle when the **RECALCULATE** flag is used. 

The number of bars spent in drawdown, and other bar statistics at the end of the simulation can be found under **Strategy statistics**. 

## *Example:* 

## printf("\nBar %i of %i",Bar,NumBars); 

## LookBack 

Number of bars that are executed before Zorro can begin to trade (default = **80**). Required for most **indicators** or other functions that need a certain amount of previous price history for their calculations. If left at the default value, it is automatically adapted to the needed lookback period by subsequent indicators. Otherwise set it to a value that is sure to cover the longest period of all used indicators, assets, and time frames. Set it to **0** when the script needs no lookback period. The maximum lookback period for live trading is one year; for even longer periods the **PRELOAD** flag should be used. Backtests can have any lookback period as long as it does not exceed the total number of bars. 

## LookBackNeeded 

Initially **0**; automatically set by any indicator or function to the maximum lookback period needed so far (see example). If **LookBack** is at its default and only a single asset is used, **LookBack** is automatically set to **LookBackNeeded**. 

If **LookBack** is set to a value less than **LookBackNeeded,** an error message is printed and the script terminates if not restarted (see example). 

## UnstablePeriod 

Runs **recursive TA-Lib indicators** over the given period (default = **40**) at any 

call. Background: Some indicators are influenced by an infinite number of past bars. They are recursive or cumulative - indicators "with memory". Examples are the **EMA** (Exponential Moving Average) and the **ATR** (Average True Range). They use their previous bar's value in their algorithm, which in turn use the value of their previous bars, and so forth. This way a given value will have influence on all the subsequent values. In contrast, a simple moving average (**SMA**) only reflects the average of its time period, without any influence from bars further in the past. 

Because a price series is always finite and starts at a certain point, the effect of missing past bars is the more significant, the closer to the start a recursive indicator is calculated. Thus a trade strategy using the EMA or derived indicators (such as the **MACD**) could behave different dependent on its bar number. 

The **UnstablePeriod** value allows to strip off such initial unstable period and remove the influence of all bars prior to this period. This way indicators are guaranteed to behave the same way regardless of the amount of past data. For coming as close to the real cumulative formula as possible, strip off as much data as you can afford. Using 40 bars (default) is reasonable for most indicators.  

## LookBackResolution 

Candle resolution of the historical data that is loaded at **trading start** for filling 

the lookback period, in minutes. Also used for **assetHistory**. At **0** (default), the resolution is equivalent to **BarPeriod**. If **BarOffset** is active or **.t1** data is used, the lookback resolution is accordingly increased. 

Set **LookBackResolution** to **1**, **5**, **15**, **30**, **60**, **240**, or **1440** for enforcing a higher or lower resolution of the lookback data. A higher lookback resolution can replicate the backtest better when **tick functions** are used, a lower resolution can help with long lookback periods when the broker history is limited. 

## TradesPerBar 

Maximum number of trades per bar, or **0** (default) for automatically estimating the maximum. Determines the allowed total number of trades when multiplied with the assets and bars of the simulation. Also affects the maximum allowed number of **series**. Opening more trades causes an **Error 049** message. Set this to a higher value when the strategy needs to enter an unusual number of trades or create an unusual number of series, as for special systems such as grid trading, or for training an **advise** function. Set it to a low value, such as **1**, for saving memory when the system does not trade more often than once per bar on average.

## MinutesPerDay 

Minimum daily trading time of the least traded asset in minutes (default = **360**, i.e. 60 minutes \* 6 hours). Internally used for determining the maximum lookback time. Set this to a lower value when **Error 047** indicates that the lookback period gets not enough historical bars at trading start. This can be the case when an asset is only traded a few hours per day, or when you use a **bar** function that produces only a few bars per day.*** 

## *Type:* 

## int *Remarks:* 

All variables on this page must be set before loading an **asset**. 

The number of the first bar at which a trade can be entered is greater or equal to **Lookback**. All trades are skipped before that bar. 

If **LookBack** is not set by script, it is automatically set to the maximum time period of all used indicators, and a message "**Lookback set to nnnn bars**" is printed to the window and log file. Automatic setting is not always possible, for instance when different **time frames** are used, when indicator time periods change in the training run, or when different assets require different lookback periods. In that case set **LookBack** by script to the maximum needed value. 

If indicators get their data from other indicators - for instance, taking the a SMA of another SMA, or normalizing the value of an indicator 

\- **LookBack** should be set to at least the sum of all time periods of the nested indicators. 
\***
`   `Setting **Lookback** to **0** overrides all internal lookback checks. You must be sure that a lookback period is really not needed. Otherwise the script can try to access nonexiting history, causing an error or a crash. 

When using series with an offset (f.i. **myseries+n**), make sure 

that **LookBack** is always higher than the required lookback period of the series plus **UnstablePeriod** plus the highest offset. Otherwise the series length can be exceeded, resulting in a script error at runtime. 

When **optimizing** the time period of an indicator, make sure 

that **LookBack** is big enough to cover the maximum time period of the optimize range, plus the **UnstablePeriod** when the indicator is recursive. Do not optimize the **LookBack** period itself, since it must not change anymore after loading the first asset. 

## UnstablePeriod is only used for recursive TA-Lib indicators. For other recursive indicators such as LowPass, DominantPeriod, UO, 

etc. **LookBack** serves as unstable period.  

In [***Trade***] mode, price history covering the **LookBack** duration is downloaded from the server immediately before trading starts. Due to weekends and market hours, the lookback duration is normally longer 

than **LookBack \* BarPeriod**. The downloaded history usually exceeds the lookback duration by a safety margin, but does not exceed 1 year. A longer lookback duration requires the **PRELOAD** flag and available price history. A too long lookback period will be indicated with a warning message. 

When trading multiple assets, the lookback period can be truncated for assets that have no price data at lookback begin. Use 

the **COMMONSTART** flag to enforce full lookback periods for all assets. Otherwise, use **AssetFirstBar** to check when the lookback period is over 

for a particular asset. 

## *Example:* 

## *// restart script when lookback period is exceeded* void run() 

## { 

`  `**LookBack = max(30,LookBackNeeded);** 

`  `**...** 

`  `**SMA(seriesC(),50); *// need more than 30 bars!*** 

`  `**if(LookBack < LookBackNeeded)** 

`    `**return quit("+Restart with new LookBack");** 

`  `**...** 

## }
