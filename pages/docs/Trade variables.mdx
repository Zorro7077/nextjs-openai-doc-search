# ï»¿Trade variables 

In a selected trade, the variables listed below available for evaluation and partially for modification. Trades are automatically selected in a TMF or in 

a **trade loop**. They can also be selected by setting the **ThisTrade** pointer, f.i. with **ThisTrade = enterLong();**. In this case check if **ThisTrade** is nonzero, since accessing a variable of a nonexisting trade will cause **Error 111**. Without a selected trade, i.e. outside a TMF or trade enumeration loop and with no 

set **ThisTrade** pointer, **trade variables have no meaning**. 

## TradePriceOpen 

The average ask price at which the trade or contract was filled; or the current ask price if the position was not yet filled. The fill price differs 

from **TradePriceOpen** by **TradeSpread** depending on trade direction.

## TradePriceClose 

The average ask price at which the position was closed or the contract was sold or covered. If the position is still open, it's the current best ask price of the asset or contract. If an option was exercised or expired, this variable contains the underlying ask price at expiration.

## TradeSpread 

The ask-bid spread at the trade opening time for short trades, or at the current and trade closing time for long trades.

## TradeStrike 

The strike price of the traded option (if any). **TradeUnderlying** 

The underlying price of the traded option (if any). 

## TradeRoll 

The current accumulated rollover/swap of the trade, negative or positive. Calculated by multiplying the trade duration with the trade volume and 

the **RollLong**/**RollShort** value. Trades that last shorter than 12 hours get no rollover. If **RollLong** and **RollShort** are both at **0**, **TradeRoll** can be modified by the TMF for using a broker-specific swap calculation. If the broker API provides current rollover/swap values for open trades, **TradeRoll** is read from the broker API.

## TradeMarginCost 

The margin cost of the trade per underlying unit, set up at entry 

from **MarginCost**. Can be modified by the TMF for more complex margin calculations. The current allocated margin amount of the trade 

is **TradeMarginCost \* TradeLots**.

## TradeCommission 

The commission cost of the trade per underlying unit, set up at entry 

from **Commission**. Can be modified by the TMF for using different commissions on entry and exit, or for more complex commission calculations.

## TradeProfit 

The current profit or loss of the trade in units of the account currency, including costs such as spread, rollover, slippage, and commission. With no trade costs and no spread, the current profit of a trade 

is **(TradePriceClose-TradePriceOpen)\*TradeUnits**. The volume-neutral profit of the trade in pips is **TradeProfit/TradeUnits/PIP**. On **NFA compliant** accounts the profit is estimated, as there is no profit assigned to a single trade. For options, **TradeProfit** is determined by the difference of premium and current contract price. If the option is expired or was exercised, **TradeProfit** is determined by the extrinsic value, i.e. the difference of strike and underlying price minus the premium.

## TradeDir 

## 1 for a long trade and -1 for a short trade.

## TradeUnits 

Conversion factor from price change to win/loss in account currency units; normally **TradeLots\*PIPCost/PIP** for assets, or **TradeLots\*Multiplier** for options or futures. Examples see below. The price move equivalent to a certain profit (not considering spread and commission) is **Profit/TradeUnits**. 

## TradeDate 

The time in Windows Date format when a pending trade with **OrderDelay** will be opened. For open trades, the time at which it was opened.

## TradeExitDate 

The time in Windows Date format when the trade was closed (for closed trades) or will expire (for open or pending trades). The expiry date of options or futures is **ymd(TradeExitDate)**.

## TradeMFE 

Maximum favorable excursion, the maximum price movement in favorable direction of the trade. Only valid after the trade was 

opened. **TradeMFE\*TradeUnits** is the highest profit of the trade in account currency units while it was open (without trading costs).

## TradeMAE 

Maximum adverse excursion, the maximum price movement in adverse direction of the trade. Only valid after the trade was opened. **TradeMAE\*TradeUnits** is the highest loss of the trade in account currency units while it was open (without trading costs).

## TradeEntryLimit 

Entry limit; initially calculated from **Entry**. The trade will be opened when the price reaches this value. Can be modified by the TMF by setting it to the desired price (not to a distance!).

## TradeStopLimit 

Current stop level, initially determined from **Stop**, and modified by trailing. Only valid when the trade is open. The trade will be closed when the price reaches this value. Can be modified by the TMF by setting it to the desired price (not to a distance!).

## TradeStopDiff 

Difference of the initial price to the initial stop limit; negative for long trades and positive for short trades. Initially determined from **Stop** and only valid when the trade is open. When **TradeStopLimit** was moved by trailing, the original stop position can be retrieved through **TradePriceOpen+TradeStopDiff**.

## TradeProfitLimit 

Profit limit, initially calculated from **TakeProfit**; only valid when the trade is open. The trade will be closed when the price reaches this value. Can be modified by the TMF by setting it to the desired price (not to a distance!). 

## TradeTrailLimit 

Trail limit, initially calculated from **Trail**; only valid when the trade is open and a stop limit was set. The stop limit will be moved when the price reaches this value. Can be modified by the TMF by setting it to the desired price (not to a distance!).

## TradeTrailSlope 

Trail slope factor in the range **0..1**; only valid when the price is over 

the **Trail** limit, and a **Stop** limit was set. Can be modified by the trade function for changing the trail slope f.i. after breakeven.

## TradeTrailStep 

Trail step factor in the range **0..1**; only valid when the price is over the **Trail** limit, and a **Stop** limit was set. Can be modified by the trade function for changing the trail step f.i. after breakeven.

## TradeTrailLock 

Trail lock factor in the range **0..1**; only valid when the price is over the **Trail** limit, and a **Stop** limit was set. Can be modified by the trade function for changing the trail lock f.i. after breakeven.*** 

## *Type:* 

## float, read/only if not mentioned otherwise. Convert them to var when using them in print/printf statements!** 

## TradeVar[0] .. TradeVar[7] TradeStr[0] .. TradeStr[7] TradeInt[0] .. TradeInt[15] 

A 64-byte area in the **TRADE** struct for storing up to 8 trade-specific variables or strings, or up to 16 integers per trade. They can be accessed and modified by a TMF or a trade enumeration loop. The locations are shared, i.e. 

either **TradeVar[N]** or **TradeStr[N]** can be used, but not both with the same index **N**. Two subsequent **TradeInt** are shared with a **TradeVar** at half the index, f.i. **TradeInt[10]** and **TradeInt[11]** are shared with **TradeVar[5]**. **TradeStr** can only be modified with **strcpy** and has a maximum length of 7 characters unless extended over adjacent **TradeStr** variables. It is recommended 

to **define** meaningful names for the variables, like **#define MyLimit TradeVar[0]**. ***Type:*** 

## var, string, int 

## TradeLots 

Number of open **Lots**. If the trade was partially closed or partially filled, the number of still open or filled lots. Automatically updated when the broker APIs supports individual trades.

## TradeLotsTarget 

Number of lots to be opened. If the trade was only partially filled, **TradeLots** is smaller than **TradeLotsTarget**. To treat an unfilled or partially filled trade as if it were completely filled, set **TradeLots = TradeLotsTarget**.

## TradeLife 

Trade **life time** in bars plus 1, or **0** for no time limit.

## TradeBars 

The number of bars since the trade was entered (for pending trades) or opened (for open trades). Not valid for resumed trades since they have no opening bar.

## TradeBarOpen 

Number of the opening bar of the trade. For pending trades, the number of the bar at which the trade was entered. Can be set to the current bar number (**Bar**) for resetting the wait time of pending trades. After the trade is opened, this number must not be changed anymore. It is not valid for resumed trades since they have no opening bar.

## TradeBarClose 

Number of the closing bar of the trade, or **0** if the trade is still open.

## TradeContract 

The contract type for options and futures, a combination of **PUT**, **CALL**, **EUROPEAN**, **BINARY**, or **FUTURE**.

## TradeID 

Trade identifier number, normally identical to the order ticket number in the broker platform. **0** when the trade was not yet opened, **-1** when the trade is identified not with a number, but with a **TradeUUID** string.*** 

## *Type:* 

## int 

## TradeUUID 

The trade identifier string when **TradeID == -1**.

## TradeAlgo 

The **algorithm identifier** of the trade. Also set to **Algo** during a TMF.

## TradeAsset 

The **asset** name of the trade. Also set to **Asset** during a TMF or a **trade loop**. ***Type:*** 

## string, read/only 

## TradeIsShort 

Boolean expression. Is **true** when the trade was entered with **enterShort**. **TradeIsLong** 

Is **true** when the trade was entered with **enterLong**. **TradeIsContract** 

Is **true** when the trade is an option or future contract.

## TradeIsCall 

Is **true** when the trade is a call option.

## TradeIsPut 

Is **true** when the trade is a put option.

## TradeIsAsset 

Is **true** when the trade used the same asset that was currently selected.

## TradeIsPhantom 

Is **true** when the trade was entered in **phantom mode** for virtual hedging or for equity curve trading.

## TradeIsPool 

Is **true** for a pool trade for **virtual hedging**.

## TradeIsVirtual 

Is **true** for a phantom trade for **virtual hedging**.

## TradeIsPending 

Is **true** when the trade was not yet opened, f.i. because it was just entered or its **Entry** limit was not yet met.

## TradeIsMissed 

Is **true** when the enter or exit order was unsuccessful due to an **OrderLimit**.

## TradeIsUnfilled 

Is **true** when a GTC trade was opened and was not immediately filled. For determining the initial fill amount, compare **TradeLots** with **TradeLotsTarget**.

## TradeIsOpen 

Is **true** when the trade was opened and is not yet closed.

## TradeIsClosed 

Is **true** when the trade was completely closed. This is the last TMF execution of the trade. The **TradeProfit** variable contains the final result.

## TradeIsExpired 

Is **true** when the **contract** of the trade was expired. **TradeIsNewBar** 

Is **true** in a TMF at the first tick of a new bar.

## TradeIsEntry 

Is **true** in a TMF when the **Entry** limit was hit. Unless the TMF returns **4**, the trade will now be opened.

## TradeIsStop 

Is **true** in a TMF when the **Stop** limit was hit. Unless the TMF returns **4**, the trade will now be closed and the TMF will then be called a final time 

with **TradeIsClosed**.

## TradeIsProfit 

Is **true** in a TMF when the **TakeProfit** limit was hit. Unless the TMF returns **4**, the trade will now be closed and the TMF will then be called a final time 

with **TradeIsClosed**.*** 

## *Type:* 

## bool, read/only 

## ThisTrade 

The **TRADE\*** pointer in a trade loop or TMF. All trade variables are accessed through this pointer. The **TRADE** struct is defined in **include\trading.h**. Its members are the above trade variables, redefined to easier-to-memorize names in **include\variables.h**. **ThisTrade** can be set by script (f.i. **ThisTrade = enterLong();**) for accessing variables of a just opened trade, but will not keep its value between **run** or **tick** functions. 

## *Remarks:* 
\***
`   `All trade variables listed above can only be accessed inside 

a **TMF**, inside a **trade enumeration loop**, or when **ThisTrade** was explicitely set to a valid **TRADE\*** pointer. In all other cases they have invalid content. If **ThisTrade** was set from **enterLong/Short**, check the pointer for nonzero before accessing a trade variable. Any access to a trade variable will cause an invalid pointer crash when 

the **ThisTrade** pointer is 0. 

Asset specific variables, such as **PIP**, **PIPCost** etc. are automatically set to the trade asset during a TMF or a trade enumeration loop, unless you explicitely prevent this by switching to a different asset. For using algorithm specific variables in a TMF, such as **trade statistics** or **AlgoVar**, the **algo** function must be called in the TMF (see **example**). 
\***
`   `Most trade variables are of type **float**. They are normally         automatically converted to **var** in lite-C, exept for functions that have no fixed variable type such as **printf()**. For directly printing trade variables, place a **(var)** before them in the **printf** parameter list to convert them 

to **var**. 
\***
`   `Make sure that all TMFs return a value. Ending the TMF function without a return value can cause wrong or random trading behavior. 

The **TICKS** flag is often required for testing TMFs that use intrabar prices or enter / exit trades. 

TMFs can open new trades with **enterLong**/**Short**. However be careful when assigning them the same TMF: mistakes in entry conditions can lead to an endless loop of entering new trades. Exit a trade by returning **1**, rather than calling **exitTrade**. 

Trades can be entered and exited by returning **1** or **2** even during the weekend or holidays when price quotes arrive and the **BR\_SLEEP** flag is not set. 

TMFs can have a heavy performance footprint. For tasks that are not related to a certain trade, using a **tick** function is preferable to a TMF. For scanning through multiple trades, a **for(open\_trades)** loop is preferable to a TMF. 

Functions that affect the program flow - like **loop**, **optimize**, etc. - can not be called in a TMF. Data **series** cannot be created in a TMF, and indicators that create data series can not be called; but series and indicator values can be evaluated through global variables or **asset/algo** 

## specific variables. Static series can be shifted in a TMF using 

the **shift** function. 

The current candle is incomplete within a TMF, so its range and height normally deviates from the other candles. The **price** functions return different values because they get their open, high, and low prices from the incomplete candle.
