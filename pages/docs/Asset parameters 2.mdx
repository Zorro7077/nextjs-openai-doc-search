# ï»¿Asset parameters 2 

## PIP 

Size of 1 price point (pip) of the current **asset** in units of the counter currency, f.i. **0.0001** for **EUR/USD**. Can be used to set a price in pips, f.i. **Stop = 10\*PIP**. For converting a price difference to pips, divide it by **PIP**.

## PIPCost 

Value of 1 pip profit or loss per **lot** in units of the account currency; determined by the lot size (**LotAmount**) and the exchange rate of account currency and counter currency. This value should normally remain constant during the simulation for not adding artifacts to the strategy performance figures; but if desired for special purposes, it can be calculated by script to fluctuate with the exchange rate (see example below). When the asset price rises or falls by **x**, the equivalent profit or loss in account currency is **x \* Lots \* PIPCost/PIP**. The counter currency exchange rate - its value in account curreny units - is **PIPCost / (PIP \* LotAmount)**.

## MarginCost 

Required margin for puchasing and holding 1 **lot** of the current asset in units of the account currency.Either directly taken from the asset list, or calculated from the leverage by **MarginCost = Asset price \* PIPCost / PIP / Leverage**. The number of lots at a given margin is **Margin / MarginCost**. For options and futures, **MarginCost** is calculated per underlying unit. The variable is updated in real time when the asset list contains a negatve MarginCost parameter that represents **Leverage**. For special margin requirements, f.i. for covered options or **option combos**, set this variable in the script to the maximum of initial, maintenance, and end-of-day margin per underlying unit before entering the trade.

## Leverage 

Asset value divided by margin cost. Determines the account's buying power, i.e. the asset amount that can be purchased with account 

currency. **MarginCost** and **Leverage** can be converted into each 

other:  **Leverage** = **Asset price \* LotAmount \* CCValue /** 

## MarginCost or Leverage = Asset price \* PIPCost / PIP / MarginCost, 

where **CCValue** is the value of the counter currency in account currency units. For brokers that support 

the **SET\_LEVERAGE** command, **Leverage** and **MarginCost** must be set on the fly before entering a trade.

## LotAmount 

The number of contracts per **Lot** with the current asset. Determines the minimum order size and depends on the lot size of the account. For currencies, the lot size 

of a micro lot account is normally **1000** contracts; of a mini lot 

account **10000** contracts; and of a a standard lot account **100000** contracts. Some brokers offer also lot sizes that are a fraction of a contract, f.i. **0.1** contracts per lot for CFDs or diginal coins. Some brokers allow arbitrary lot amounts when they support the **SET\_AMOUNT** command.

## LotLimit 

Maximum number of **Lots** with the current asset 

(default: **1000000000/LotAmount**). Can be set to a smaller number for safety reasons. If the number of lots exceeds this limit, for instance due to a script bug, the order is not executed and an error message is issued.

## InitialPrice 

The initial asset price taken from the **asset list**. Can be set to the first historical price and used to adapt parameters (such as **MarginCost**) to asset price changes in the backtest (f.i. **MarginCost = InitialMarginCost \* priceClose() / InitialPrice**). 

## AskPrice 

The last ask price of the current asset in live trading mode or by calling **priceQuote**. The last bid price is **AskPrice - Spread**. ***Type:*** 

## var, read/only if not mentioned otherwise (edit the Asset List for permanently changing asset parameters). 

## AssetBar 

Bar number of the last received price quote of the current **asset**, from **1** (first bar) up to **Bar** (current bar). Can be used to determine if there was a quote in the current bar.*** 

## *Type:* 

## int, read/only *Remarks:* 

Asset specific parameters are only valid after selecting the **asset**. 

When Zorro is connected to a broker, it loads the current asset parameters from the broker's server if available. Otherwise they are taken from the current **asset list** (normally **History\AssetsFix.csv**). The asset list can be edited with a spreadsheet program or a text editor for simulating different brokers, accounts, and assets in backtests; or it can be automatically updated to the parameters of the current broker account. 

## *Examples:* 

## *// set stop / profit target at a fixed pip distance* 

## Stop = 10\*PIP; 

## TakeProfit = 40\*PIP; 

## *// let profits fluctuate with the account currency* *exchange rate* function convertProfits(string Rate) 

## { 

`  `**char OldAsset[15];**  

`  `**strcpy(OldAsset,Asset); *// store original asset*** 

`  `**if(!asset(Rate)) return;** 

`  `**var Price = price();** 

`  `**asset(OldAsset);** 

`  `**if(Price > 0.)** 

`    `**PIPCost = PIP\*LotAmount/Price;** 

## } 

## *// call this function from run(), f.i.*  convertProfits("EUR/USD"); *// when account currency = EUR and counter currency = USD.*
