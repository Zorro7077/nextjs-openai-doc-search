# ï»¿Commitment Of Traders Report 

The Commitments of Traders (COT) is a market report by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), listing the holdings of participants in futures of financial instruments, metals, and other commodities. It is believed by some traders to give insight into the upcoming development of those markets. The CFTC releases a new report every Friday at 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time, and the report reflects the commitments of traders on the prior Tuesday. 

The following functions return selected parts of the COT report, and work likewise in backtest and live trading: 

## COT (int Handle, string Code, int Field): var 

Downloads the COT report with the given Quandl **Code** and stores it in the dataset with the given **Handle**. Returns the positions determined by 

the **Field** number for the time of the current bar.

## COT\_CommercialPos (int Handle, string Code): int 

As before, but returns the net commercials position, i.e. the difference producer + swap dealer longs - producer + swap dealer shorts.

## COT\_CommercialIndex (int Handle, string Code, int TimePeriod): var 

As before, but returns the commercials net position normalized over the given **TimePeriod** and scaled to 0..100.

## COT\_OpenInterest (int Handle, string Code): var 

As before, but returns the open interest. ***Returns:*** 

Positions, net positions, or index. ***Parameters:*** 

## Handle  Dataset handle for storing the report. Every report needs a dedicated handle. 

## Code  The Quandl code number of the report; normally 6 digits or letters. Can be looked 

under **https://www.quandl.com/data/CFTC-Commodity-Futures-Trading-Commission** The **"CTFC/"** prefix and **"\_F\_ALL"** suffix of the Quandl database are automatically

## Field  The field of the report: 1 = open interest, 2 = producer long positions, 3 = producer 

long positions, **5** = swap dealer short positions, **6** = noncommercials long positions positions.  

## TimePeri The number of bars for calculating the index. 

## od 

## *Remarks:* 

For retrieving the COT report, **Zorro S** and a Quandl key is required (to be entered in **Zorro.ini**). 

The report is only downloaded when needed at the begin of the strategy. Subsequent function calls access the dataset only. Downloaded reports are stored in the **History** folder. 

The source code of COT functions can be found in **contract.c**,         which must be included. Note that the functions use the new COT report structure with the field names listed in the comment. If you're downlaoding a COT report with a different structure, copy the **COT** functions in your       script and adapt the conversion string as described under **dataParse**. 

## *Example:* 

## #include <contract.c> 

## *// Database symbols and codes below are just for illustration. // Current available symbols can be found on the Quandl / NASDAQ website.* 

## function run() 

## { 

`  `**StartDate = 2015;** 

`  `**EndDate = 2018;** 

`  `**BarPeriod = 1440;** 

`  `**LookBack = 12\*20;** 

`  `**set(PLOTNOW);** 

`  `**if(is(INITRUN)) {** 

`    `**assetAdd("GOLD");** 

`    `**int Handle = assetHistory("CHRIS/CME\_GC1",FROM\_QUANDL|VOLATILE); *// load gold futures history*** 

`    `**if(Handle) dataSave(Handle,"GOLD.t6");** 

`  `**}** 

`  `**asset("GOLD");** 

`  `**string COT\_Code = "CFTC/088691\_F\_ALL";** 

`  `**var Ind = COT\_CommercialIndex(1,COT\_Code,6\*20); *// gold COT report*** 

`  `**plot("Fast Index",Ind,NEW,RED);**

`  `**plot("Slow Index",Ind2,0,BLUE);** 

## } 

## slider(int number, int pos, int min, int max, string name*, string tooltip*): var 

Sets up an initial position, range, name, and tooltip for one of the three customizable sliders. Returns the current position of the slider. Depending on the selected asset or other conditions, different slider positions can be preset at the beginning.

## slider(int number): var 

Returns the position of the slider with the given **number**. The slider must have been set up before.

## slider(int number, int pos) 

Sets the slider with the given **number** to a new position. This way the script can display numerical values to the user while running. The slider must have been set up before. 

## *Parameters:* 

## number  Slider number: 0 for the Period slider, 1..3 for the 3 user-specific sliders. 

## pos  Slider position. The initial position is set when the script is run the first time. 

## min, max  Minimum (left) and maximum (right) positions of the slider, positive or negative inte name  Text displayed next to the slider (like "Margin"). If the name begins with a dot (like 

displayed in front of the last 3 digits in the edit window. 

## tooltip  Tool tip text to describe the slider function, or 0 for no tool tip. 

## *Returns* 

Current value of the slider. ***Remarks:*** 

For setting up a slider name and range, the **slider** function must be called in the initial run of the script. The **Period** slider has fixed parameters and is hard-wired to the **BarPeriod** variable. The other sliders can be freely set and defined. 

For displaying fractional values, put a dot at the begin of the slider name, and multiply the **pos**, **min**, **max** parameters with 1000. The value in the edit window is then displayed with 3 decimals. The returned value must be divided by 1000.  

The sliders are initialized to their default positions (**pos** parameter) when the script is started the first time, or when the script was edited or a new [***Script***] was selected. On subsequent starts of the same script the sliders keep their previous position. For testing a script with a manually set slider position, click [***Test***], wait until the slider names appear on the GUI, then click [***Stop***], put the sliders to the desired position and click [***Test***] again. 

In [***Trade***] mode the slider positions are stored in the **.trd** file and thus 'remember' their last position. The **.trd** file is automatically updated at any trade entry or exit, or in **TickTime** intervals when the sliders were moved. 

The **SLIDERS** fllag is set whenever a slider is moved or the number 

in the field is edited. It can be reset by script. 

Aside from the sliders, a **panel** with entry fields can also be used for user input. 

## *Example:* 

## *// Investment calculator* 

## void main() 

## { 

`  `**slider(1,10000,1,20000,"Capital","Initial capital");** 

`  `**slider(2,10000,0,20000,"Profit","Profit so far");** 

`  `**slider(3,2000,1000,2000,".Root","Root"); *// 1.000 = linear, 2.000 = square root*** 

`  `**while(wait(100))** 

`    `**print(TO\_INFO,"\rInvestment: $%.0f",** 

## slider(1)\*pow(1+slider(2)/slider(1),1./(slider(3)/1000.))); }
