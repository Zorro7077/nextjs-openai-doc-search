# ﻿Time series statistics 

Library of often used functions for evaluating properties of time series or data arrays. See also **Normalization**. 

## correl(vars Data, int Length, function): var 

Spearman correlation of the **Data** series with an arbitrary **function**. Used for the **CTI**, **CCYI**, and **CCYIR** indicators. Source in **indicators.c**; usage and description on **Financial Hacker**. 

## Correlation(vars Data1, vars Data2, int TimePeriod): var 

Pearson's correlation coefficient between two data series over the 

given **TimePeriod**, in the range between **-1..+1**. A coefficient of +1.0, a "perfect positive correlation," means that changes in **Data2** cause identical changes 

in **Data1** (e.g., a change in the indicator will result in an identical change in the asset price). A coefficient of -1.0, a "perfect negative correlation," means that changes in **Data2** cause identical changes in **Data1**, but in the opposite direction. A coefficient of zero means there is no relationship between the two series and that a change in **Data2** will have no effect on **Data1**. This function can be also used to get the autocorrelation of a series by calculating the correlation coefficient between the original series and the same series lagged by one or two bars (**series+1** or **series+2**). 

## Covariance(vars Data1, vars Data2, int TimePeriod): var 

Covariance between two data series. Can be used to generate a covariance matrix f.i. for the **markowitz efficient frontier** calculation.

## Fisher(vars Data): var 

Fisher Transform; transforms a normalized **Data** series to a normal distributed range. The return value has no theoretical limit, but most values are between **-1 .. +1**. All **Data** values must be in the **-1 .. +1** range, f.i. by normalizing with 

the **AGC**, **Normalize**, or **cdf** function. The minimum **Data** length is **1**; a 

single **var** can be passed with the **&** operator, f.i. **Fisher(&MyVariable).** Source in **indicators.c**.

## FisherInv(vars Data): var 

Inverse Fisher Transform; compresses the **Data** series to be between **-1** and **+1**. The minimum length of the **Data** series is **1**; a single **var** can be passed with 

the **&** operator, f.i. **FisherInv(&MyVariable)**. Source in **indicators.c**.

## FisherN(vars Data, int TimePeriod): var 

Fisher Transform with normalizing; normalizes the **Data** series with the 

given **TimePeriod** and then transforms it to a normal distributed range. Similar to a **Normalize** filter (see below), but more selective due to the normal distribution of the output. The return value has no theoretical limit, but most values are in 

the **-1.5 .. +1.5** range. The minimum length of the **Data** series is equal 

to **TimePeriod**. The function internally creates **series** and thus must be called in a fixed order in the script. Source code in **indicators.c**.

## FractalDimension(vars Data, int TimePeriod): var 

Fractal dimension of the **Data** series; normally **1..2**. Smaller values mean more 'jaggies'. Can be used to detect the current market regime or to adapt moving averages to the fluctuations of a price series. Requires a lookback period of twice the **TimePeriod**. Source in **indicators.c**.

## Gauss(vars Data, int TimePeriod): var 

Gauss Filter, returns a weighted average of the data within the given time period, with the weight curve equal to the Gauss Normal Distribution. Useful for removing noise by smoothing raw data. The minimum length of the **Data** series is equal to **TimePeriod**, the lag is half the **TimePeriod**. Source in **indicators.c**.

## Hurst (vars Data, int TimePeriod): var 

Hurst exponent of the **Data** series; between **0..1**. The Hurst exponent measures the 'memory' of a series. It quantifies the autocorrelation, i.e. the tendency either to revert to the mean (**Hurst < 0.5**) or to continue trending in a direction (**Hurst > 0.5**). This way the Hurst exponent can detect if the market is in a trending state. The **TimePeriod** window (minimum **20**) must have sufficient length to catch the long-term trend; the lookback period must be at least twice the **TimePeriod**. The function internally creates **series** and thus must be called in a fixed order in the script. Source in **indicators.c**.

## LinearReg(vars Data, int TimePeriod): var 

Linear Regression, also known as the "least squares moving average" (LSMA). Linear Regression attempts to fit a straight trendline between several data points in such a way that the distance between each data point and the trendline is minimized. For each point, the straight line over the specified previous bar period is determined in terms of **y = b + m\*x**, where **y** is the price and **x** the bar number starting at **TimePeriod** bars ago. The formula for calculating **b** and **m** is then 

## m = (nΣxy - ΣxΣy) / (nΣx² - (Σx)²) b = (Σy - bΣx) / n 

where **n** is the number of data points (**TimePeriod**) and **Σ** is the summation operator. The **LinearReg** function returns **b+m\*(TimePeriod-1)**, i.e. the **y** of the current bar.   

Source in **ta-lib.zip**. For higher order regression or for evaluating the regression value at past or future bars, use **polyfit / polynom**. For logistic regression with multiple variables, use the **advise(PERCEPTRON,...)**. 

## LinearRegAngle(vars Data, int TimePeriod): var 

Linear Regression Angle. Returns **m** converted to degrees. Source in **ta-lib.zip**. 

Due to the arbitrary x and y units of a price chart, the angle is a mostly useless parameter, although held in high esteem by Gann believers. 

## LinearRegIntercept(vars Data, int TimePeriod): var 

Linear Regression Intercept. Returns **b**. Source in **ta-lib.zip**. 

## LinearRegSlope(vars Data, int TimePeriod): var 

Linear Regression Slope. Returns **m** as data difference per bar. Source in **ta-lib.zip**. 

## MatchIndex(vars Data, var Reference, int Period): int 

Index of the **Data** value closest to **Reference** over the specified **Period**.  **0** = best match is at current bar, **1** = at one bar ago, and so on. If the **Data** series was shifted (**+N**), add the offset **N** to the returned index for getting the number of bars passed since the best match. Source in **indicators.c**.

## MaxIndex(vars Data, int Period): int 

Index of highest **Data** value over the specified **Period**.. **0** = highest value is at current bar, **1** = at one bar ago, and so on. If the series was shifted (**+N**), add the offset **N** to the returned index for getting the number of bars passed since the lowest **Data** value. Source in **ta-lib.zip**. 

## MaxVal(vars Data, int Period): var 

Highest **Data** value over the specified **Period**. Source in **ta-lib.zip**. 

## Median(vars Data, int Period): var 

Median Filter; sorts the elements of the **Data** series and returns their middle value within the given **Period**. Useful for removing noise spikes by eliminating extreme values. The minimum length of the **Data** series is equal to **Period**, the lag is half the **Period**. Source in **ta-lib.zip**. See also **Percentile**. 

## MinIndex(vars Data, int Period): int 

Index of the lowest value over a specified period; **0** = lowest value is at current bar, **1** = at one bar ago, and so on. If the series was shifted (**+N**), add the offset **N** to the returned index for getting the number of bars passed since the lowest **Data** value. Source in **ta-lib.zip**.  

## MinVal(vars Data, int Period): var 

Lowest value over a specified period. Source in **ta-lib.zip**. 

## MinMax(vars Data, int Period): var 

Lowest and highest values over a specified period. Result in **rMin**, **rMax**. Source in **ta-lib.zip**. 

## MinMaxIndex(vars Data, int Period): int 

Indexes of lowest and highest values over a specified period. Result 

in **rMinIdx**, **rMaxIdx**. **0** = current bar, **1** = one bar ago, and so on. Source 

in **ta-lib.zip**.

## Mode(vars Data, int TimePeriod, int Steps): var 

Most frequent **Data** value within **TimePeriod**. For this the **Data** range is divided into **Steps** separate ranges, and the number of values that fall into a range is counted. The function returns the value with the highest count. Source 

in **indicators.c**. 

## Moment(vars Data, int TimePeriod, int N): var 

The statistical moment **N** (**1..4**) of the **Data** series section given by **TimePeriod**. The first moment is the mean, second is variance, third is skewness, fourth ist kurtosis. The standard deviation is the square root of the second moment. The mean is stored in **rMean**. See also **SemiMoment**. Source in **indicators.c**.

## NumInRange(vars Low, vars High, var Min, var Max, int Length): var 

Number of data ranges, given by their **Low** and **High** values, that lie completely inside the interval from **Min** to **Max** within the given **Length**. Can be used to calculate the distribution of prices or candles. **Low** and **High** can be set to the same value for counting all values in the interval, or swapped for counting all candles that touch the interval. Returns a value of **1..TimePeriod**. Source 

in **indicators.c**. See also **PercentRank**.

## NumRiseFall(vars Data, int TimePeriod): var 

Length of the last streak of rising or falling values in the **Data** series, back to the given **TimePeriod**. For a rising sequence its length is returned, for a falling sequence the negative length (f.i. **-3** when **Data[3] < Data[2] > Data[1] > Data[0]**). Range: **1..TimePeriod-1**. See the **RandomWalk** script for an example. Source in **indicators.c**. 

## NumUp(vars Data, int TimePeriod, var Theshold): var NumDn(vars Data, int TimePeriod, var Theshold): var 

Number of upwards or downwards **Data** changes by more than the given **Threshold** within the **TimePeriod**, from **0** to **TimePeriod-1**. See also **SumUp**, **SumDn**. Source in **indicators.c**.  

## Percentile(vars Data, int Length, var Percent): var 

Returns the given percentile of the **Data** series with given **Length**; f.i. **Percent = 95** returns the **Data** value that is above 95% of all other values. **Percent =** 

## 50 returns the Median of the Data series. 

## PercentRank(vars Data, int Length, var Value): var 

The opposite of **Percentile**: Returns the percentage of **Data** values within the given **Length** that are smaller or equal than the given **Value**; returns 100 when **Value** is the greatest in the data range. Can transform any series to a 

range of 0..100. See also **NumInRange**.

## R2(vars Data, int Length): var 

Coefficient of determination (+1...-1); similarity of the **Data** series with a straight line through its end points. At **1** the data series is equivalent to a straight line, 

at **0** or below even the mean of the data is a better fit to the straight line than the real data series.

## SemiMoment(vars Data, int TimePeriod, int N): var 

The statistical moment **N** (**1..4**) of the **Data** series section given by **TimePeriod**, using only data points at or below the mean. The first moment is the mean, the second is the semivariance, third is downside skew, and fourth is downside kurtosis. The mean is stored in **rMean**. The **semideviation** (downside deviation) is the square root of the semivariance, and is often considered a better measure of risk than the standard deviation. See also **Moment**. Source in **indicators.c**.

## ShannonGain(vars Data, int TimePeriod): var 

Expected logarithmic gain rate of the **Data** series in the range of about **+/-0.0005**. The gain rate is derived from the Shannon probability **P = (1 + Mean(Gain) / RootMeanSquare(Gain)) / 2**, which is the likeliness of a rise or fall of a high entropy data series in the next bar period. A positive gain rate indicates that the series is more likely to rise, a negative gain rate indicates that it is more likely to fall. The zero crossover could be used for a trade signal. Algorithm by **John Conover**. Source in **indicators.c**.

## ShannonEntropy(vars Data, int Length, int PatternSize): var 

Entropy of patterns in the **Data** series, in bit; can be used to determine the 'randomness' of the data. **PatternSize** (2..8) determines the partitioning of the data into patterns of up to 8 bit. Each **Data** value is either higher than the previous value, or it is not; this is a binary information and constitutes one bit of the pattern. The more random the patterns are distributed, the higher is the Shannon entropy. Totally random data has a Shannon entropy identical to the pattern size. Algorithm explained on the **Financial Hacker** blog; source 

in **indicators.c**.

## Spearman(vars Data, int TimePeriod): var 

Spearman's rank correlation coefficient; correlation between the 

original **Data** series and the same series sorted in ascending order 

within **TimePeriod** (**1..256**). Returns the similarity to a steadily rising series and can be used to determine trend intensity and turning points. Range **= -1..+1**, lag 

= **TimePeriod/2**. For usage and details, see Stocks & Commodities magazine 2/2011. Source in **indicators.c**. 

## StdDev(vars Data, int TimePeriod): var 

Standard Deviation of the **Data** series in the time period, from 

the **ta-lib;** accuracy = **0.0001**. For long time periods, higher accuracy, or for 

downside deviation, use the square root of the second **Moment or SemiMoment**. 

## Sum(vars Data, int Length): var 

Sum of all **Data** elements up to the given **Length**. Source in **ta-lib.zip**.

## SumUp(vars Data, int Length): var SumDn(vars Data, int Length): var 

Sum of all upwards or downwards **Data** changes up to the given **Length**. See also **NumUp**, **NumDn**. Source in **indicators.c**.

## SumSq(vars Data, int Length): var 

Sum of the squares of all **Data** elements up to the given **Length**. Source code in **indicators.c**. 

## TSF(vars Data, int TimePeriod): var 

Time Series Forecast. Returns **b + m\*(TimePeriod)**, the Linear Regression forecast for the next bar. 

## Variance(vars Data, int TimePeriod): var 

Variance of the **Data** series in the time period, accuracy = **0.0001.** Source 

in **ta-lib.zip**. For long time periods, higher accuracy, or for downside variance, use the second **Moment or SemiMoment**. 

## *Standard parameters:* 

## TimePeriod  The number of bars for the time period of the function, if any; or 0 for using a defa Length  The length of the Data series. 

## Data  A data series, in reverse time order, usually  derived from the price functions

Alternatively a user created series or any other double float array with the given mi not mentioned otherwise, the minimum length of the **Data** series is **TimePeriod** second data series **Data2**.  

## *Usage example:* 

## Volatility(Prices,20) calculates the standard volatility of a daily price series over the last 20 days.*** 

## *Remarks:* 

The **TA-Lib** function prototypes are defined in **include\functions.h**. The C source code of all included TA-Lib indicators is contained 

in **Source\ta\_lib.zip** and can be studied for examining the algorithms. Some TA-Lib indicators that originally didn't work properly - such as Correlation or SAR - have been replaced by working versions. The C source code of most additional indicators that are not part the the TA-Lib is contained in **Source\indicators.c**. 

TA-Lib indicators can only be used 

between **INITRUN** and **EXITRUN**, since TA-Lib and series management are released at end of the session. This restriction does not apply when the **STRAIGHT** flag is set. 

## TimeFrame affects subsequent data series and thus also affects all indicators that use the data series as input. The TimePeriod is then not in Bar units, but in time frame units. TimeFrame has no effect on indicators that do not use data series.
