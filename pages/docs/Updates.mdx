the **AssetsFix.csv** file and by script in the **Commission** variable. The simulation now simulates a spread/commission account, instead of a pure spread account. 

In the SNB floor removal aftermath, many brokers reduced their maximum leverage from 400:1 or 200:1 to 100:1. The simulated default account (**AssetsFix.csv**) was also changed to 100:1 leverage, which 

affects the profit of most systems. 

The **Z4** and **Z5** systems are expired and have been removed from the strategy pool.

A **Monte Carlo plugin** is now available for a Monte Carlo analysis of strategy scripts and external trade lists. 

The annual return is now calculated from the maximum margin instead of the average margin. This produces slightly more pessimistic returns. 

The **R2** coefficient that measures equity curve linearity is now included in the **performance report**. 

A small example script for converting **.csv** price history files to Zorro's **.bar** format was added (needs the **file\_write** function).

Bar charts by **plotBar** are now automatically aligned so that the chart always starts with the first bar. 

The **MTR4 bridge** now supports multiple MTR4 instances on the same PC (Zorro S only). To connect to a particular MTR4 account, either the account number can be manually entered in Zorro's [***User***] field, or 

the **account selection system** can be used. 

The **-d** command line option allows to pass a **#define** statement to the script (Zorro S only). This way many different tasks can be automatized with the same script.

The **AVG** flag now allows to **plot** a value as an average curve over all oversampling cycles. 

A **Laguerre** filter was added to the **filters**. 

Comparing a function pointer with a **var** or **float** value - this can happen when forgetting the () of a function call - will now generate a compiler error. 

The **info** and **progress** commands display text and color signals in Zorro's info window and progress bar. 

Zorro can now be started from external programs with **command line options**. 

## Seasonal analysis functions have been implemented. They are also be available as an add-on for Zorro 1.05. 

The **Z12**, **Z12fx**, and **Z12nfa** combined strategies have been removed because they were found less profitable than trading Z1 and Z2 separately. Reason is an internal mechanism that evaluated open trade profits for trade decisions, which does not work well across opposite strategies such as the Z1 trend trading and the Z2 counter trend trading systems. 

## *Zorro 1.05 (January 2013)* 

The **Total down time** - the time spent below a preceding equity peak - is now displayed in the **performance report**.

The **TICKS** flag now also handles entry limits with per-tick resolution. 

## Trade functions can now also be used for individual entry limits. 

Price history files are not anymore automatically downloaded at the begin of a new year - this confused beginners and was a bad idea anyway. Instead the **assetHistory** function was implemented. 

A new broker plugin with the ForexConnectâ¢ API interface has been implemented. It provides a more stable connection than the previously used Order2Goâ¢ broker plugin. 

Logging in to the broker with several Zorro instances on the same PC will now generate an error message. 

The **Z1** / **Z2** system components are now optionally filtered with the results of an out-of-sample test with the real trading parameters. This reduces the backtest performance, but should improve the real trading performance.
