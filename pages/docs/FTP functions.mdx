# ï»¿FTP functions 

The FTP functions can be used for uploading or downloading files from a web server. 

## ftp\_download(string url, string path, string username, string password) 

Starts a file download from a FTP server. Returns **0** if an error occured, nonzero otherwise. Use **ftp\_status** to check when the transfer was complete.

## ftp\_upload(string url, string path, string username, string password) 

Starts a a file upload to a FTP server. Returns **0** if an error occured, nonzero otherwise. Use **ftp\_status** to check when the transfer was complete. 

## ftp\_getdate(string url, string username, string password) 

Starts a file access for getting the timestamp and size of a file stored on a FTP server. Returns **0** if an error occured, nonzero otherwise. Use **ftp\_status** to check when the file access was complete. 

## ftp\_stop() 

Stops the currently running FTP transfer.

## ftp\_size(): long 

Returns the total file size of the current/last file in bytes. **ftp\_sent(): long** 

Returns the amount of sent data of the current/last file in bytes.

## ftp\_timestamp(): long 

Returns the timestamp of the current/last file, after **ftp\_getdate()** was executed successfully.

## ftp\_status() 

Returns the status of a currently running or the last FTP transfer: 

## -1 if the last FTP transfer was stopped because of an error 0 if the FTP transfer is still running 

## 1 if the last FTP transfer was successful 

## ftp\_log (var mode) 

Enables/disables the logging of FTP transfers. The logfile is named **"ftp\_log.txt"**.*** 

## *Parameters:* 

## url - URL of the file to be downloaded, or destination URL for a file upload (e.g.: 

"ftp://www.testhoster.com/downloads/test.txt"). **path** - local path + filename (e.g.: "testdir/test.txt") **username** - FTP username 

## password - FTP password 

## mode - 1 to enable, 0 to disable FTP logging *Remarks:* 

Only one FTP transfer can be run at the same time. After 

calling **ftp\_download(), ftp\_upload() or ftp\_getdate()** wait until the value of **ftp\_status()** is nonzero. 

For uploading or downloading to SFTP servers, or for other FTP/SFTP operations such as creating directories, get **curl.exe** and run it with **exec**. Example: **exec("C:\\Tools\\curl.exe","-k \"sftp:/myserver.host/upload/\" --user \"myname:pass\" -T \"Data\\file.txt\" --ftp-create-dirs",1);**. 

## *Example:* 

## function main()  

## {  

## *//Downloads the file "myfile.txt" and saves it in the Data folder*  

## ftp\_download("ftp://www.testhost.com/files/myfile.txt","Dat a/myfile.txt","username","password");  

`  `**while(!ftp\_status()) *//as long as the download is running*     wait(50);** 

`  `**if (ftp\_status() == 1)**  

`    `**printf("\nDownload successful!");**  

`  `**else**  

`    `**printf("\nDownload failed!");**  

## }
