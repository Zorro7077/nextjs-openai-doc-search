The **DATE** format is equivalent to a **double** / **var** variable and counts the number 

of days since 12-31-1899 with a resolution of 1 µsec.

## s 

- Unsigned decimal number (int, char) 

## u 

- Hexadecimal number (int, char), lowercase 

## x 

- Hexadecimal number (int, char), uppercase 

## X 

- Percent sign 

## % 

Format modifiers (optional, after the %) : 

## n  Field width, minimum number of digits. 

## . Precision, maximum number of digits after the decimal. m 

## -  Left align the result within the given field width. 

## +  Prefix the output value with a sign (+ or –). 

## 0  Add zeros until the number of digits is reached. 

## ' '  Add a blank ' ' if the output value is signed and positive. Special characters 

## \a  Audible alert 

## \b  Backspace 

## \f  Form feed 

## \n  New line, or linefeed \r  Carriage return 

## \t  Tab 

## \v  Vertical tab 

## \\  Backslash 

## #. Print to log only 

## .. 

## *Regular expressions, for the Npp search functions* 

Code Matches Example **\*** 

Preceding item zero or more times; like **{0,}**. 

zo\* matches "z" and "zoo". 

## + 

Preceding item one or more times; like **{1,}**.

## \d 

Digit character; equivalent to **[0-9]**. 

In "12 345", \d{2} matches "12" and "34". \d matches "1", 2", "3", "4", "5". **\D** 

Nondigit character; equivalent to **[^0-9]**. 

\D+ matches "abc" and " def" in "abc123 def". 

## \s 

Any white-space character; like **[ \f\n\r\t\v]**. 

## \S 

Any non-white-space character; like **[^ \f\n\r\t\v]**. 

## \w 

## A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and underscore, like [A-Za-z0-9\_]. 

In "The quick brown fox…", \w+ matches "The", "quick", "brown", "fox". **\W** 

Any character except **A-Z**, **a-z**, **0-9**, underscore. 

In "The quick brown fox…", \W+ matches "…" and all of the spaces. **()** 

Start and end of a subexpression. 

A(\d) matches "A0" to "A9". (f|b)\*oo matches foo, boo, and oo. **[abc]** 

A character set; matches any specified character. 

[abc] matches the "a" in "plain". 

## [^abc] 

Negative character set; any not specified character. 

[^abc] matches the "p", "l", "i", and "n" in "plain". 

## [a-z] 

A range of characters; any character in the range. 

[a-z] matches any lowercase character in the range "a" through "z". **[^a-z]** 

Negative range; any character not in the range. 

[^a-z] matches any character that is not in the range "a" through "z". **[a,b]** 

All items separated with commas. 

[a-z,-] matches all characters in "my-file". 

## {n} 

Preceding item exactly **n** times.  

o{2} does not match the "o" in "Bob", but the two "o"s in "food". 

## {n,} 

Preceding item at least **n** times.  

o{2,} does not match the "o" in "Bob" but all the "o"s in "foooood". **{n,m}** 

Preceding item at least **n** and at most **m** times.  

In "1234567", \d{1,3} matches "123", "456", and "7". 

## \cx 

The control character indicated by **x**. 

\cM matches a CTRL+M or carriage return character. 

## \xnn 

A 2 digits hexadecimal character.
